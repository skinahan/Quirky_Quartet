The reason is that your input has multiple types and you need to handle them differently.  For example, if you have two lists of strings then you can just use <code>zip()</code>.  If you have two lists of tuples then you can just use <code>zip()</code>.  But if you have one list of strings and one list of tuples then it's impossible to do this with a single function because there are no values in common between these types (you would need to convert the string into a tuple or vice versa).   You could write separate functions for each case but that would be silly since Python already provides these functions for us: <code>zip()</code>, <code>map()</code>, and <code>itertools.izip_longest()</code>.   There's no sense in reinventing the wheel when we already have perfectly good wheels available.   So what should we do?  We should write our own generic \"zipping\" function which calls one of those three built-in zipping functions as needed.  Here's how it might work:\n\n    def myzip(*iterables):\n\n        # First get all iterables into a consistent form where they're all tuples or all lists (or both)\n\n        iterables = [tuple(iterable) for iterable in iterables]\n\n        # Next find out what type they are so we know how to handle them later on...\n\n        iterable_types = set(type(iterable) for iterable in iterables)\n\n        # Now we know how many different types there are...\n\n        number_of_types = len(iterable_types)\n\n        # We only need to worry about 2 cases: either all elements are tuples or all elements are lists (or both).   Anything else is illegal input so raise an exception...    \n\n        if number_of_types > 2:     # more than 2 types means illegal input!      raise TypeError(\"All arguments must be either",

Use correct data structure to derive the needed answer. You can assume that all elements in each sub-tuple are comparable with one another and also with elements in other sub-tuples. You can assume that all elements will be unique across each sub-tuple but not necessarily unique within each sub-tuple itself.  A linear search is ok as long as it's implemented correctly and doesn't exceed O(n^2). Also pay attention to what happens when you sort an empty list or an empty tuple or an empty dictionary or an empty set etc...  This is not just about sorting tuples but also sorting any iterable container using its first element as key for comparison while sorting it.  For example if you have a list like this [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']] then after sorting it would become [['c', 'd'], ['a', 'b']]. In general your function should work on any iterable container which contains iterable containers inside it such that after sorting them by their first element they get sorted correctly according to their first element as key for comparison while sorting them.  You can assume that all elements in each sub-container are comparable with one another and also with elements in other sub-containers regardless of what type they are eiher integers or strings or floats etc... But you cannot assume anything else about them except that they will always be comparable with one another regardless of what type they are eiher integers or strings or floats etc... So this means your code should work even if we change those numbers into strings like this [['1', 'b'], ['c",
