The <code>heapq</code> functions all work in-place and don't return anything, so your list comprehension is just creating a new list of the same elements in the original array (in no particular order).  You can verify this by printing out the arrays before and after calling your function.   This code will do what you want:  <code>[heapq.heappop(array) for i in range(len(array))]</code>.  Note that it would be more Pythonic to write this as <code>[heapq.heappop(array) for _ in array]</code>.   Also, if you want to sort an array using a heap, you can just call <code>list = heapq.nsmallest()</code>, which returns a new sorted list without modifying the original one, instead of having to call both <code>push_pop()</code> and <code>list = heapq.nsmallest()</code>.   Finally, note that if you're going to use Python's built-in sorting functions instead of implementing your own from scratch or using a custom sorting algorithm like heapsort, then there's no need to use heaps at all; just call <code>sorted()</code>.   However, I'm guessing that this is some kind of exercise where you're supposed to implement sorting yourself rather than using built-in functions like sorted().     If so then it might be useful for me to point out that your code seems unnecessarily complex; there are simpler ways of implementing heapsort than what you've done here (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort#Pseudocode).     Also note that while heapsort has an average case running time of O(nlogn), its worst case running time is O(nlogn); see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort#Comparison_to_other_sorting_algorithms .      In my opinion this makes it less useful than quicksort or mergesort (both",
