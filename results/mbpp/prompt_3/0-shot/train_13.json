A power set is a set that contains all possible subsets of a given set. For example, if you have a set {a, b}, then the power set would be {{}, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}. Note that an empty subset is also considered as one of the element in the powerset. The order does not matter and should be from minimum length to maximum length subsets. All elements in a subset should be sorted in ascending order and subsets themselves should also be sorted in ascending order as shown above. Also note that duplicate elements are not allowed in any subset or powerset (set with no duplicate elements). For example, if you have two sets with duplicates say S1 ={1, 2} and S2 ={2, 3} then their powerset would be P1 ={{}, {1}, {2}} and P2 ={{}, {2}, {3}} respectively where P1 and P2 are not equal but they are equivalent (equal number of elements). Another example would be S3={5} whose power-set would be {{}{5}} which is equivalent to {{}{5}} which has two empty sets instead of one empty sets but both have equal number of elements i.e., 1 element each (order does not matter) but they are not equal because {} != {} . Finally note that an empty set has only one subset i.e., itself which is an empty set as well i.e., {{}} . In short; your output for input [] should return [[]] . This also applies for any other single element input list containing duplicates such as [4] , [7] , [6] etc where output will always contain only one subset i.e., [[]] or [[4]] or [[7]] or [[6]] etc depending on your input list respectively irrespective of whether it contains duplicates or not because there can only exist one unique empty subset per given input list irrespective whether it contains duplicates or not since an empty subset can never contain",
