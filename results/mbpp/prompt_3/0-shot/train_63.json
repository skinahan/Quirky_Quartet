The sentence is passed as a string. Ignore punctuation marks and spaces while finding the longest word. If two words are of same length then consider the one with lower index as longer word. Return \"Invalid input\" if any other datatype is passed instead of string. Only alphabets are allowed in the input string and words may be separated by single space only (no tabs).  Additional info: Pay attention to the datatype of input and expected output. Is the input a tuple? Is the input a string? Is the input a matrix? Use correct data structure to derive the needed answer. Answer: def longest_word(sentence): \"\"\" :param sentence: A sentence passed as string :return: Longest word in given sentence ignoring punctuations \"\"\" if not isinstance(sentence, str): return \"Invalid Input\" import re # Remove punctuations from given sentence without_punctuations = re . sub('[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]', '', sentence) # Split into words words = without_punctuations . split() if len(words) == 0 or len(words[0]) == 0: return \"Invalid Input\" # Sort based on length longest = sorted(words, key=len)[-1] return longest Question Write a python function that takes two strings s1 and s2 and returns True if they are anagrams otherwise False . Two strings are anagrams if they have same set of characters but different orderings e.g., 'earth' and 'heart' are anagrams because both have same set of characters ['e', 'a', 'r', 't', 'h'] but different ordering whereas strings like 'python' and 'jython' are not anagrams because set of characters for both strings are different ['p', 'y', 't', h'] vs ['j','y','t','h','o','n'",

The input may contain duplicates. Do not use any built-in functions or methods. Note that, you are not allowed to use any control statements or loops. The input list will always contain only integers. Do not modify the original input list. You can make changes in the copy of the original input list if needed for your solution. For example, if the original input is [1, 2, 3], then you can create two lists as [1] and [2]. But you should return two lists as [1] and [2, 3]. \nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question and return a tuple with two lists (odds and evens) containing odd numbers followed by evens from an array of given integers without using any control statement or looping constructs like while or for etc., You may assume that there will be at least one element in each array which is either an odd number or an even number (not both). The order in which odds appear in output should be same as they appear in input array and similarly for even numbers also. For example if we have an array[3, 1, 2] then we should return ([3], [1, 2]).  If we have another array[3, 1] then we should return ([3], [1]) since there are no even elements in it. If we have another array[2] then we should return ([],[2]) since there are no odd elements in it. Hint: You can use string slicing method on string representation of integer value but this method might give wrong answer when your code encounters negative values so you need some other way to handle negative values too (Hint: Try using abs() function). Also note that this problem does not require sorting so please don\u2019t waste time on sorting algorithms here!  In case if you find difficulty solving this problem without using loops/control statements/any built-in methods/functions then please feel free to use them but try solving it without them first before looking",
