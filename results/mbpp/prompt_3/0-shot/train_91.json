Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Additional info: Pay attention to the datatype of input and expected output. Is the input a tuple? Is the input a string? Is the input a matrix? Use correct data structure to derive the needed answer. Answer: def sum_of_squares(n): total = 0 for i in range (1, n+1): total += i*i return total print (\"The sum of squares of first\", n ,\"natural numbers is : \",sum_of_squares(10)) Output : The sum of squares of first 10 natural numbers is : 385 Question: Write a python function to check whether or not an integer is divisible by another integer. Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Additional info: Pay attention to the datatype of input and expected output. Is the input a tuple? Is the input a string? Is the input a matrix? Use correct data structure to derive the needed answer. Answer def checkDivisibility (a, b): if (a % b == 0): print (\"Yes\") else : print (\"No\") checkDivisibility (10, 5) Output Yes Question Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn . Task Write a Python program that accepts an integer (n) and computes th e value o f n +nn +nn . Do not use any built-in Python functions such as str(), eval() etc.. Sample value o f n is 5 , so 5 + 55 + 555 = 615 . Note : The parameter 'number' should be positive integer . # Function which calculate value o f number with two parameter # Parameter number - This will be our number # Parameter times - How many time we need append given number def computeNumber(number, times): result = \"\" for x in range(times): result +=",
