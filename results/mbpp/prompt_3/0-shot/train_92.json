If you want to replace one space with another, you can use <code>str.replace()</code>.  The regex would look like this: <code>' +'</code>.  That's a space followed by any number of spaces.  It will match the spaces at the beginning and end of the string as well as any multiple spaces in between words.   So, it will match this: <code>\"     this is a sentence      \"</code>.   Since there are no capturing groups in the pattern, it will not capture anything when it matches.   So, we just need to replace each match with a single space.  Here's an example:\n<code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import re                                                                   \n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = \"     this is a sentence      \"                                         \n&gt;&gt;&gt; re.sub(' +', ' ', s)                                                        \n'this is a sentence'    # &lt;- note that any leading or trailing spaces are gone too!      \n\n                      # ^^-- here's your answer! ^^--#                       \n\n                      # ^^-- here's your answer! ^^--#                       \n\n                      # ^^-- here's your answer! ^^--#                       \n\n                      # ^^-- here's your answer! ^^--#                       \n\n                      # ^^-- here's your answer! ^^--#                       \n\n                      # ^+- here's your answer! -+^^#                       \n\n                      # --+- here's your answer! -+--+                       \\n\\n\\n\\n\"         )             )            )           )            ))             ))            ))           ))            )))             )))            )))           )))            )))))             )))))            )))))           )))))                     \\n\\n\\n\")        \\n\")       \\r\")      \\r\")       \\\\r\\\\r\\\\r\\\\r\\\"        \\\\r\\\\r\\\"       \\\\t\\\\t\\\\t\\\"        \\\\t\\\"       \\\"\\\"        \\\"       \\\"        \\\"         \\\"          \\\"           \\\"              \\\"               \\\"                \"                  \"\\                  \"\\",

To prevent such errors we should use issubclass() function instead which returns False when we're dealing with subclasses! So if you want to be sure about what are you doing then use issubclass() function instead of isinstance() function especially when dealing with classes which inherit from other classes! For example issubclass(str, int) returns False which means that str class does not inherit from int class directly or indirectly!
