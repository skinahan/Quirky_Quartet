To overcome this we can use numpy's isclose() function which checks for approximate equality between two numbers within a tolerance value which is by default set to 1e-8 (0.00000001). So if you want to change it then you can pass a value to it as an argument like numpy.isclose(x,y,atol=0.001) where 0.001 is your tolerance value (absolute tolerance). This will check for approximate equality between x and y within a tolerance limit of 0.001 units (absolute tolerance). For example - np.isclose(0.0001234567891234567890, 0) will return True as it's absolute difference is less than 1e-8 units i..e 10^-8 units from zero and hence considered equal but np.isclose(0.0001234567891234567890, 0) will return False as it's absolute difference from zero is greater than 1e-3 units i..e 10^-3 units from zero and hence considered unequal so be careful while choosing your tolerance value depending upon your problem statement/data values etc... But in case you just want to check whether they are exactly same without considering any approximation then just use '==' operator like above code which only checks exact equality between them without considering any approximation ie., no floating point error/tolerance issue etc... So choose wisely depending upon your problem statement/data values etc...",
