Note that this will only work for strings, not tuples. Tuples are immutable, so you can't modify them in place like this, and even if you could, it would be meaningless to do so (since tuples are meant to be used as collections of data). If you need to modify a tuple in a similar way, you can convert it into a list first using <code>list()</code>, apply your changes to it, then convert it back into a tuple using <code>tuple()</code>. This is really only useful if you're going to use the modified values elsewhere in your code though; otherwise just converting your input into a list would probably make more sense. You could also use <code>\"\".join()</code>, but I don't think that's what they're looking for here since they specifically asked for you to use regex sub: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join . If you know what regular expressions are supposed to do already then I'd suggest just looking up how Python implements them instead of asking about them here though; there's plenty of info on Google about how they work in other languages and Python's implementation is pretty much identical from what I've seen from my own experience with them (I'm no expert though). It might also help if you explain exactly why they want you to use regular expressions here instead of just telling us that they did; maybe there's some reason we don't know about?

This solution uses a loop to iterate over the characters in the input string and appends them to a new string.  If we encounter a space, we append \"%20\" instead of just one character.  We can use either StringBuilder or concatenation for this purpose.   StringBuilder is slightly faster because it doesn't create as many strings, but I'm not sure if it's worth the extra code complexity in Python since there are no primitives like Java.  Overall, this solution is pretty efficient and straightforward to understand.   The only thing I don't like about it is that it requires two passes over the input string (one to count spaces and one to actually do replacements).   I think it would be possible to keep track of how many spaces have been encountered so far (using an int variable), then calculate how much extra space we need while doing replacements on-the-fly during the second pass, but I think that would make this solution less readable without gaining any efficiency benefits.    You could also skip counting spaces altogether by first checking if there are any spaces at all before doing any replacements - this will be more efficient for inputs with no spaces (i.e., best case = O(1) time).     If you're allowed to use additional data structures (like an array), you could also split() on whitespace and join() on \"%20\" - these operations are both O(n) time, so overall runtime would still be linear but you'd save some memory by not creating an intermediate list of words from splitting on whitespace like split() does behind-the-scenes (but again, probably not worth it since Python doesn't have primitive types).     You could also use regular expressions with re.sub() - that would be more concise than using += operator or StringBuilder in a loop but less efficient than either option because regular expressions involve backtracking which makes them slower than simple linear operations like concatenation or appending characters one by one using += operator or StringBuilder/StringBuffer's append() method (see here for more info",
