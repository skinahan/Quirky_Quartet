The function should return True if the list contains all unique elements and False otherwise. The input is an integer list. The output is True or False. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Pay attention to the datatype of input and expected output. Is the input a tuple? Is the input a string? Is the input a matrix? Use correct data structure to derive the needed answer. Example: If you have an array [1,2,3], it should return True since all elements are unique but if you have an array [1,2,3,3] it should return False since first 3 and second 3 are same element so it is not unique element anymore.\n\n     Task: Write a python function to solve the above question without using any built-in functions/methods like set(), etc. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Pay attention to the datatype of input and expected output as described above for this question also for other questions in this quiz series (unless specified otherwise). You can use any built-in functions/methods except set() for other questions in this quiz series unless mentioned otherwise (like using map() instead of writing your own map() method). Hint: You may use sort() method here but you don't have to use sort(). Try solving it without using sort().\n\n     Answer: \n\n     '''\ndef check_unique_list(input_list): #O(N^2) solution possible O(nlog n) solution too with sorting! \n    for i in range(len(input_list)-1):  #O(n) time complexity due to looping through each element once! \n        if (input_list[i] in input_list[i+1:]): #O(n) time complexity due to looping through each element again!   Total time complexity is O(N^2)!   O(nlog n) solution too with sorting possible!  See below commented code!
