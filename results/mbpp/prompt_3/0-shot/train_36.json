Then you don't have to write <code>amount[0]</code>. Instead you can use <code>cost</code>, which is the first element of your tuple. The same goes for the second element of tuple. You can call it <code>price</code>. For example:  <code>def isNoProfitNoLoss(cost, price): ...</code>. Also, I would recommend using Python's built-in function <code>all()</code>. It takes an iterable and returns true if all elements are true or if iterable is empty. In your case it will check that both cost and price are equal or not. If they are equal, then it will return true otherwise false. For example: <code>return all([cost == price])</code>. The final code will look like this:  \n<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">\n<p><pre><b><i><br/>def isNoProfitNoLoss(cost, price):<br/>return all([cost == price])<br/></i></b></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n",
