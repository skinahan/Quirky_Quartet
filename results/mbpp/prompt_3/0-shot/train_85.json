For example given [1,-1],[-1,1], your function should return [(1,-1),(-1,1)]. You can use any programming language you like but please explain how you will solve this problem with your code snippet or pseudo code if you can't write it out because you're not familiar with that language yet! Please also give an estimate on time complexity for your solution! Answer : def getZeroSumCombinations (lista , listb) : result = [] for i in range (len (lista)) : for j in range (len (listb)) : if ((lista [i] + listb [j]) == 0 ) : result . append ((lista [i], listb [j]) ) return result Question: Write a function that takes an integer n as input and outputs all prime numbers up to n inclusive using a generator or iterable object that yields prime numbers on demand without storing them all at once or using recursion or loops directly Answer: def primes(): yield 2; yield 3; yield 5; yield 7; p=11 while True: if p%2==0 or p%3==0 or p%5==0 or p%7==0: pass else: yield p p+=2 def genPrimesUptoN(n): for x in primes(): if x > n : break else : print(\"{}\".format(x), end=\"",
