So return itself as the answer (smallest prime divisor). This can be done because we have already checked all numbers less than its square root and none divides it so there can't be another factor which divides it except itself (i = num) and 1 which is already handled in above cases so this case will never come to execute for those cases. This case will only execute when i = num (when we reach end of loop). So this condition works for all cases whether its a composite or a prime number :) . It returns itself when its a prime or returns one of its factors when its composite :) .
