If the length of the string is odd there should be two characters in the middle. (e.g., \u201cW3Re\u201d). In case of even number, the middle two characters should not be considered as middle (e.g., \u201cW3Resour\u201d). The function should return a tuple containing two strings. The first element in tuple is first half and second element is second half of the given string. If input is an empty string, then output should be empty strings as well in both elements of tuple. For example, if input is \u201cPython\u201d then output should be (\u201cPyt\u201d, \u201chon\u201d) and if input is \u201cPytHon\u201d then output will be (\u201cPytH\u201d, \u201con\u201d) . If input is an empty string then output will also be an empty tuple (both elements are empty strings). In all other cases you can assume that input will always have at least one character and it will only contain letters from English alphabet or digits from 0 to 9 inclusive i-e [0-9a-zA-Z]. You cannot use builtin functions like split() or partition(). You need to write your own logic for this task. Hint: Use slicing operator [:] to divide any sequence into 2 parts i-e [start : end]. Note that start index starts from 0 while end index starts from 1 i-e [0 : 1] means it includes only first character of sequence while [1 : 2] means it includes only second character of sequence but not third character because third character starts at index 2 i-e [2 : 3]. Similarly you can use negative indices with slicing operator which means you can slice sequence starting form right side instead left side by using negative indices with slicing operator i-e [-1] means last character while [-2] means second last character etc.. So [-1 : ] means everything starting form last index till end while [-2 : ] means everything starting from second last till end etc\u2026 .",
