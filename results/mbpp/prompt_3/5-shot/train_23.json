In this case use recursion for all other cases except when n < 1, i.e., recursion only for when n >= 1 . If you are not aware about recursion then refer https://www.w3schoolsin/python/python_recursionin/. Test your code with various values such as 10 or 123456789123456789 etc.. You may need some additional helper functions in this case like get_next_digit(). Check your code by using pytest library module in Python which helps in writing unit tests for your code https://docsin/pytestin/. Or you can also write your own test cases along with your solution code itself by using assert keyword from Python built-ins which helps in writing unit tests for your code https://docsin/pythonin/3/library/unittestin/#module-unittest . Note that you are not allowed to use any built-ins related functions like int(), len(), split(), join(), etc.. except assert keyword from Python built-ins for this question but you can use any other Python built-ins like range() etc.. . Also note that do not write any print statements inside your solution function since we will check its output by calling it from our test cases only and printing anything will fail our test cases since they expect only integer value as output without any print statements inside them but we will read all print statements outside it so feel free to write",
