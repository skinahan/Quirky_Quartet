The function should return the prime number list and the count of prime numbers. For example, if n=10, then it should return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19] and 8. If n=20 then it should return [2, 3, 5 ,7 ,11 ,13 ,17 ,19] and 8. If n=30 then it should return [2 ,3 ,5 ,7 ,11 ,13 ,17 19 23 29] and 10. Note that the given number is always greater than 2. Also note that you have to use list comprehension to solve this question. You cannot use any other python constructs such as map(), filter(), lambda etc., to solve this question. You can use only if-else statements inside list comprehension to solve this question (if needed). Please refer https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python for more info on list comprehension constructs in Python (if needed). The solution code will be auto evaluated by our system based on these constraints only and no other constraints are applied during auto evaluation of your code (if any). So please make sure that your solution adheres to these constraints only while solving this question or else your answer evaluation might fail when auto evaluated by our system even though your code passes all test cases when run locally on your machine (if any). You can assume that input number is always greater than 2 and you don't need check for invalid inputs or raise exceptions etc., in your code (if any). Also note that you don't need to print anything or take input from user etc., just implement the given function and pass/return the expected result as mentioned above without modifying the given function header respectively as required in the question above before submission so that our system can auto evaluate your answer as mentioned above without issues based on our constraints only . Please note that we will not consider partial marks awarded for partially correct answers which do not adhere to these constraints but passes all test cases when run locally on user machine during evaluation of their answers after contest ends if any so please make sure you",

Also do not use any built-in functions/libraries for input/output handling or string manipulation like split(), join() etc., Also do not use try/except blocks unless absolutely necessary; i.e., you can handle invalid inputs with assertions only (assert statements are already provided). Do not change the indentation or variable names provided in template except for adding your own code wherever required. Also do not change file name or function name; you must write solution code inside function body starting at line number 17 and make sure that it compiles without errors when submitted on edX platform; if it does not compile on edX platform due to some reason then it will lead to mark deductions during evaluation and you might get zero marks even if your solution is correct as per sample test cases locally due to compilation issues on edX platform which is out of our control so please take care about this aspect while coding your answer below:\n\n  Task:\n\n  Write a python function to solve the above question.
