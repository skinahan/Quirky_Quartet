The function should return two integers, which are the indices of the first buy day and sell day respectively. You must buy before you sell, i.e., you can't buy-sell-buy-sell or buy-buy-sell-sell sequences and you can only hold at most one unit of stock at a time. If it's not possible to make any profit, return (-1, -1). The indices returned by your function should each be in the range [0, len(prices) - 1]. Note that if you're not allowed to make any transactions at all, your profit will be zero but since we want you to maximize your profit, we won't consider this case as an error and instead return (-1, -1).\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.
