An empty tree is height-balanced. A non-empty binary tree T is balanced if: 1) Left subtree of T is balanced 2) Right subtree of T is balanced 3) The difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree is not more than 1. If a tree has n nodes, its height will be at least log2(n+1). So we can say that the time complexity of above solution will be O(nLogn). In worst case, we may have a skewed tree, then the time complexity becomes O(n2). This problem can also be solved using single traversal of binary tree using post order traversal. Thanks to Amar for suggesting this method. The idea behind this method is, the left and right subtrees of a node differ in height by at most one. We traverse the given Binary Tree in Postorder and find the height of left and right subtrees from bottom up. If difference between heights if more than one then \u201ctree\u201d is not balanced, else it is balanced. The below implementation also returns height of tree as an additional information in recursive calls to itself (similar to getHeight() function used in above implementation). Time complexity of this solution would be O(N), since it makes one traversal over given Binary Tree. This solution requires O(H) extra space where H is height of given Binary Tree for function call stack but it doesn\u2019t require any extra space for storing auxiliary data structure like HashMap or ArrayList used by previous solutions as it uses recursive calls to find heights instead which are stored on stack during recursion call as shown below: Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.

If there are more than one such sub-string of longest possible length, then print any one of them. The given string contains only lowercase English alphabets (a-z). The value of k is less than or equal to 26. If no such sub-string exists, then print an empty string. For example: if the string is \"araaci\" and value of k is 3, then output should be \"araa\". Also if input is \"cbbebi\" and value of k is 3 then output should be \"cbb\". If input is \"aa\" and value of k is 1 then output should be \"aa\". If input is \"\" and value of k is 5 then output should be empty string. If input string contains all unique characters and value of K = n where n = length(input_string), then whole input_string will be printed as answer. In case if there are multiple answers possible for a particular test case, any one among them can be considered as valid answer (see example 2). The solution should have linear time complexity. Order of characters in the output does not matter so long as it has all unique characters from the original array in same order as they appear in original array (i.e., order of characters in the output sub-array/sub-string need not match that in original array) .\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.
