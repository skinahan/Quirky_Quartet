Also, print the denominations of coins used. Assume that an infinite supply of coins are available. The coin denomination values may be given as a list/tuple in any order. You may assume that all the values are positive and distinct from each other. For example, if the coin denominations are given as (1, 5, 6, 8), then the minimum number of coins required to make change for sum 11 is 2 (5 and 6). Similarly, if the coin denominations are given as (5, 8) then it is not possible to make change for sum 11 using these denominations since no combination adds up to 11. Use dynamic programming approach to solve this question. Your solution should run in O(mn) time where m is length of denom array and n is value to be changed using those denoms. If it\u2019s not possible to make change for n using given denoms then return -1.\\nNote: This problem also known as Coin Change problem and has been discussed in class before with different inputs/outputs so please do not use your old solution here or try discussing with friends about this problem or search online resources before solving this question.\", \"question_type\": \"Code\", \"question_format\": \"python\", \"question_difficulty\": 2}, {\"question_id\": 3,\"question_name\": \"Question 3\",\"question_text\": \"Write a function that takes two lists A and B containing integers sorted in ascending order, and returns a new sorted list which contains all elements from A and B.\", \"question_type\": \"Code\", \"question_format\": \"python\", \"question_difficulty\": 3}, {\"question_id\": 4,\"question_name\": \"Question 4\",\"question_text\":\"Write a python function which takes two lists L1 & L2 as input arguments and returns True if they have at least one common member else return False.\",  \t\"answer\":\"def common(L1 ,L2):\\n    result = False\\n    s = set(L2)\\n    for x in L1:\\n        if x in s:\\n            result = True\\n           ",
