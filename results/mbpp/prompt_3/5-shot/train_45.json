If no common prefix is found, return an empty string \"\". The longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 and S2. A simple approach is to use vertical scanning for all array elements. We compare characters from top to bottom on the same column (same character index of the strings) before moving on to the next column. We have discussed another approach in this article - Longest Common Prefix using Divide and Conquer Algorithm. The time complexity of above solution is O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings. In worst case, we also need O(mn) space for storing all strings.
