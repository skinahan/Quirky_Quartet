You can only climb one or two steps at a time. The number of steps is an integer value. You can assume that all inputs are positive integers. For example, for n = 4, there are 5 possible ways to reach the top: [1,1,1,1], [2,1,1], [2,2], [1,2,1] and [1,1,2]. Your function should return 5 in this case. The order in which you take these steps does not matter. For example your function should still return 5 even if you take the first step as 2 instead of 1 and so on. In other words you may take any valid combination of steps that add up to n but the order in which they are taken does not matter. Your function should also work if n is zero or less than zero and should always return 0 in such cases since there is no way to reach the top with negative number of stairs or without taking any stairs at all! In fact for any value less than zero your function should always return 0 since it is not possible to climb negative number of stairs! So your function must handle both positive and negative values gracefully! Hint: You may want to use recursion here! Also note that this problem is similar (but simpler) than climbing a ladder with variable step sizes where each step can have different size from previous one (e.g., first step can be 3 units high whereas second step could be 5 units high). Here we have fixed step sizes so it's easier! Also note that this problem has been asked by Google in their interviews before so make sure you solve it before your interview :) Good luck! :) \n\n */",
