If it is, then print the index position where the second string starts. If it is not, then print -1. Do not use the built-in find() method. You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters and spaces. The length of each string will be at least 1 character and at most 1000 characters. If you are given two empty strings, then print 0 as their starting index position. For example, if you are given the strings \"programming\" and \"ram\", then your function should print 8 because \"ram\" starts at index 8 in \"programming\". If you are given the strings \"hello\" and \"world\", then your function should print -1 because there is no substring of \"hello\" that matches exactly with \"world\". The empty string \"\" matches anything so if you are given two empty strings (\"\"), then your function should print 0 as their starting index position. You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters and spaces. The length of each string will be at least 1 character and at most 1000 characters. Do not use any built-in Python functions or methods such as find(). Your program must run in less than 1 second for all test cases combined (this includes reading input from stdin). Your program must read input from stdin and write output to stdout (or to a file specified on the command line). To run your program on our input files, use this command line: python3 substring_matching_stdio filename where filename represents our input file name which contains 2 lines with space separated values representing each string respectively according to the problem statement above. For example: $ cat sampleinput1 hello world $ cat sampleinput2 programming ram $ cat sampleoutput1 -1 $ cat sampleoutput2 8 In this example we have 2 inputs files named sampleinput1 & sampleinput2 respectively with 2 lines containing space separated values representing each string respectively according to the problem statement above & we have 2 output files named sampleoutput1 & sampleoutput2 respectively with single line containing single integer value representing answer according to problem statement above",
