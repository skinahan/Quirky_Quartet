A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from V to U. In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, or u belongs to V and v to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set. Also note that the graph may not be connected. For example in the following graph there are 3 connected components: one containing vertices 1-3 only; one containing vertices 4-5 only; and one containing 6-7 only. Note that all the edges are between two different sets i.e., either between 1-4 or 2-5 or 3-6 or 7-8 but not within any set such as 1-2 or 4-5 etc.. The following graph is also Bipartite as we can divide its vertices into two independent sets {1, 3} and {2, 4}. The following graphs are not Bipartite because they have an odd cycle which contains at least one edge connecting two vertices in same set (marked with red color). We need not consider those components which are singleton i.e., contain only one vertex because they do not have any cycles at all \u2013 they cannot be bipartite nor non bipartite! Also note that an empty graph (which does not contain any edges) is considered as Bipartite by our definition here since it has no cycles at all! Input Format : Line 1 : Two integers N and M Each of the next M lines : Two integers ui and vi denoting there is an edge from ui to vi Output Format : Maximum number of edges possible Given below is the representation of input graph Output 9 For explanation see above image Note: The output may be different with different approaches but the answer will always remain within 10^9 + 7 range Explanation The given undirected input graph has 6 connected components where each component has",
