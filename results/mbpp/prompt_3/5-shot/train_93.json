The string is passed as an argument to the function. Ignore whitespaces and punctuations in the given string. Return a tuple with two numbers, first being number of words and second being number of characters without whitespaces and punctuations in it. If there are no words, return None, None instead of 0, 0 respectively. The order of your output should be same as sample output provided below:\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Also, do not use any built-in functions to calculate length or count words or characters except len(). Assume that input will always be a valid string without any special characters or numbers other than alphabets and spaces between them which need to be counted as word separator only once even if there are multiple spaces between two words (as shown in sample input). So this condition must hold true for your solution - \"Hello world! How are you?\" ==> 3 15 . Note that punctuation marks like ! , . ? etc should also be ignored while counting characters but multiple spaces must be counted as one space only for counting words where each word is separated by one space character only (even if there are multiple spaces between two words). In case you would like to know more about this problem statement, please read this wikipedia article on algorithm for counting number of words or this stackoverflow discussion on how many ways can we count number of words in a sentence? . You may also find these links useful while solving this problem - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . You may assume that there will always be at least one word in the given sentence but no sentence will have more than 100 letters including spaces between them (so maximum possible value returned by your function should be 100 + 1 = 101). Please note that you can use split() method which gives you list of all tokens/words present in given string but make sure that it does not affect correctness of your solution since split() is used here just for hint/clarity purpose only so it's optional usage here i.e., you can solve this problem even without using split().

Return 0 if no such substring exists. Go through the sample input and output to understand the expected output format. Note: k will be less than or equal to 26. Also, n will be less than or equal to 15000 for 30% of the test cases and n will be less than or equal to 500 for remaining 70% of the test cases. All characters in a string will be lowercase alphabetical letters only i.e., from \u2018a\u2019 \u2013 \u2018z\u2019 . Go through the sample input and output to understand the expected output format. The order of characters in a substring need not necessarily be same as that of characters present in any particular position of input string, but it should come from same string only i.e., no character should come from different strings even though it is present at same position as that of character present at some position in input string.. For example, if there are two strings \u201cabcd\u201d and \u201ccdef\u201d then answer should not contain any character from second string even though they are present at same positions as those of first one because you have to pick up all characters from single string only.. If there are multiple answers with maximum length then print any one of them (i.e., just print longest substring without worrying about which one you printed). For example, if your answer is \u201cbcb\u201d then you can also print \u201cabc\u201d (or vice-versa). But don't print both because they both are correct answers with same length 3.. If there is no possible answer then return 0 (i.e., don't just return empty list). For example, for n = 6 and k = 2, if input is \"acbbac\", then you have two possible answers - \"acbba\" & \"cbaca\". In this case you need to return either \"acbba\" or \"cbaca\". You can't return empty list because both these substrings have maximum length 6 which is greater than 0.. Don't worry about time/space complexities because this part won",
