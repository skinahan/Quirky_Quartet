The characters are case-sensitive. For example, if the input is \"abc\" and the character is \"a\", then the output should be 1, and if the input is \"Abc\" and the character is \"a\", then output should be 0. If there are no characters that match with given character, then return -1. Do not use any built-in functions or methods to solve this question. Use your own logic to solve this question. You can write additional helper classes/functions as required by you but do not change the name of main function which takes three arguments as described above (input_string, char, and expected output). If you change the name of main function, your code will throw an error while executing test cases on our platform. You can write other helper functions as per your requirement but they will not be tested on our platform because we only test main function against test cases provided by us (as mentioned above). If you have written other helper functions or classes in your code but they are not being used in main function then those functions or classes will also not be tested by our platform against test cases provided by us because we only test main function against test cases provided by us (as mentioned above). In case if you want to submit multiple solutions for this question then please make sure that all solutions have different names for their respective main functions otherwise it will throw an error while executing test cases on our platform because we only execute one solution at a time for each question against all available test cases for that particular question on our platform so if two solutions have same name for their respective main functions then it will throw an error while executing test cases on our platform due to naming conflict between two different solutions having same name for their respective main functions which means both solutions cannot be executed simultaneously due to naming conflict between two different solutions having same name for their respective main functions which means both solutions cannot be executed simultaneously due to naming conflict between two different solutions having same name for their respective main functions so please make sure that all submitted solution have unique names defined as per instructions given above otherwise",

A number is said to be abundant if the sum of its proper divisors exceeds the number itself. The smallest abundant number is 12 having proper divisors 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 whose sum is 16. The next smallest abundant number is 18 whose proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9 whose sum exceeds 18 by 9. Similarly the next smallest abundant numbers are 20 and 24 having their proper divisor sums exceeding them by 5 and 7 respectively. Note that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as a sum of two abundant numbers as 28123 = 12 + 28111 where 12 and 28111 are both abundant numbers (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundant_number). So in this question you have to find whether a given integer n falls in this category or not? If it does return True else False. Note that there might be more than one ways to write n as a sum of two abundant numbers but we need only one such pair so you have to find any one such pair if exists otherwise return False indicating that n cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers). For example 20 can be written as 16 + 4 (where 16 and 4 are both abundunt) or 15 + 5 (where 15 and 5 are both abundunt) but we need only one such pair so here you will return True for 20 with any of these pairs (16+4 or 15+5). Similarly for 24 you can return True with any one of these pairs: 19+5 or 18+6 or 17+7 etc., but not with any other combination like 14+10 etc., where 14 is not an abudant number because its proper divisor 1 + 2 + 7 < 14). You may assume that n will always be greater than 0 (zero) while writing your solution code for this question which means it will always have some positive value even if it",
