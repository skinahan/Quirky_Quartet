Use the reverse of the given string to check if it is equal to the original string. Return True if it's palindrome and False otherwise. Note that strings are case sensitive (ie) Anagram and anagram are not same. Don't use any inbuilt functions/methods for this problem. You may use only the following built-in methods: str(), list(), reversed(). For example, \"Madam\" is a palindrome as reversed('Madam') = 'madAm' and 'madAm' == 'Madam'. Hint: Use list() method to convert string into list and use [::-1] slicing technique to reverse the list. Also you can convert a list back into string by using str() method. For example, str(['M','a','d','a','m']) returns \"['M', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'm']\". You may also need ord() method which returns an integer representing Unicode code point of the character when argument is a unicode object, otherwise returns ASCII value of a character when argument is an 8-bit string. For example, ord('A') returns 65 and ord('a') returns 97. Also chr() method can be used which return a character (a string) from an integer (represents unicode code point of the character). For example, chr(97) returns 'a'. You may also need join() method which takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string without any separator between them when called on a separator object such as space (' '). For example, \"-\".join(['1','2','3']) will return \"1-2-3\". In this problem you have to implement your own logic without using any inbuilt methods/functions mentioned above except reversed(). However you may use other built-in methods like str(), list(), ord(), chr(), join(). Note that len() function will also work but don't use it for this problem because we want you to implement your own logic instead of calling len(). Examples: Input",

Assume that the string will contain only small case letters and no spaces. The output should be True if the given string is a palindrome else it should return False. If the input string is None or empty then it should return False. Also, if the length of the input string is 1 then also it should return True. For example, \"\" (empty string) and \"a\" (string with one character) are palindromes whereas \"ab\" and \"abc\" are not palindromes. Note that even though individual characters are palindromes, their combinations are not always considered as palindromes. For example, \u201cabca\u201d is not a palindrome although each of its character \u2018a\u2019, \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019 individually are palindromes. Similarly, \"abaab\" is also not a palidrome because even though its first three characters form a valid plaindrome (\"aba\"), its last three characters do not form an actual plaindrome (\"aab\"). So your function must consider all such cases to be invalid plaindromic strings. You can assume that there will be no spaces in the input string and you don't have to worry about capitalization as well i.e., capital letters can be considered equivalent to small case letters for this problem (so 'A' = 'a'). You may find below some examples of valid and invalid plaindromic strings: Examples: Input : str = 'abba' Output : True Explanation: It's obvious that 'abba' forms a valid plaindrome so output must be True Input : str = 'abbaa' Output : False Explanation: Even though first four characters form an actual plaindrome ('abba'), last two characters do not form an actual plaindome ('aa') so output must be False Input : str = 'abbccbba' Output : True Explanation: It's obvious that 'abbccbba' forms a valid plaindrome so output must be True Input : str = '' Output : False Explanation: Empty strings cannot form any",

The function should return an integer. If mean is not an integer, round it towards zero. If given list is empty, return 0. For example, [1, 2, 3] returns 2 and [-1, -2] returns -1. You may assume that all input numbers are valid integers between -100 and 100 inclusive. The list can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well. Do not modify the input list. For example, [9,-3,-3] should be considered as two instances of -3 rather than three instances of -3.[-7,-7,-7,-7] should be treated as only one instance of -7.[-5,-5,10] should be treated as two instances of -5 and one instance of 10.[9,-3,-4], [-8,-8], [-10], [2], [] are valid inputs with corresponding outputs being 5 (because (9+(-3)+(-4))/3 is 5), 0 (because (-8+(-8))/2 is 0), 0 (because (-10)/1 is 0), 2 (because 2/1 is 2) and 0 respectively.[-5-6-4] should be treated as three instances of -6 rather than two instances of -5 because you must always round towards zero.[0], [0],[0],[0],[0],[0],[0],[0],[0],[0] are valid inputs with corresponding outputs being all zeroes because there are no negative numbers in each case.[-6-90][90][34][78][90][34789023423423]-[12304534534534502345234]-[345354535345345]-[909090909090]-[3045023045020395023045020395023045020340590230540250239054090540239054902349023549023549023590429054092540925490259052903590259052903590520935902590350925490350925",

Return True if it is palindrome else return False. Do not use any built-in functions. Note that the string will contain only lowercase alphabets and spaces. For example, \"race car\" is a palindrome, but \"racecar\" is not a palindrome. Also note that you need to remove space in the string before checking for its palindromicity. For example, \"race car\" should be converted to \"racecar\" before checking for its palindromicity as there are no spaces in racecar and hence it is a valid case of palindrome. In case of empty or None input, return False . You do not need to consider special cases such as strings with only one character or strings with only spaces etc., unless you want to get bonus points for your solution :) . You may assume that the input string will contain at least one character other than space(s). Do not modify the input string! For example, if you are given an input of \"abcd\", do not convert it into \"abcddcba\". It should be treated as an invalid case of palindrome and hence your function should return False .
