Ignore case sensitivity and punctuations. If multiple words have same frequency then consider word which comes first as answer. You can use any data structure for storing words and their counts, you can write your own class or use python\u2019s default dictionaries or any other data structure of your choice. You can also write additional functions if needed. If you are using python\u2019s default dictionary then consider using OrderedDict instead of normal dictionary as it will maintain order of insertion of keys which is required here as well because we need to print answers in order they appear first in input file (See below example). You may assume that there will be only one most frequent word and it will be unique but there could be multiple least frequent words with same frequency (see below example). Your function should take two arguments filename and n where filename is name of file containing text and n is number of top most frequent words we want as output from that file e.g.: top_n_words('file_name', 2) should return two strings which are names of two most frequent words in given file e.g.: \u2018word2\u2019, \u2018word3\u2019 (in above example).
