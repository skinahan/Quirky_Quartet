Ignore the case of characters. Return the results as a dictionary. For example, input string is \u201cPython\u201d then output should be {\u2018p\u2019:1, \u2018y\u2019:1, \u2018t\u2019:1, \u2018h\u2019:1, \u2018o\u2019:1, \u2018n\u2019:1} and input string is \"Python Programming\" then output should be {'p': 2,'y': 1,'t': 1,'h': 1,'o': 2,'n': 2,' ': 1,'r': 2,'g': 2,'m': 2} . Note that space character has occurred twice in the string. Sort the keys alphabetically before returning it as output. Note that all leading and trailing whitespaces must be removed from the original string before counting starts. Also note that you need to take care of punctuation marks as well (eg., commas or exclamation marks) which may occur in some cases. The above examples are just for your understanding only and you need to write code for all possible scenarios including punctuation marks and capitalization scenarios etc., Use try-except block to handle any errors that may occur while opening or reading from a file or while writing to a file. You can assume that no error will occur when you create an empty list/dictionary or when you open an empty file but errors might occur during other operations like reading/writing into files etc., Also note that if no data is present in an input file then your program should gracefully exit without throwing any error messages on screen so use try-except blocks wherever necessary to avoid errors and make sure your program doesn't crash due to such situations. If an error occurs while opening/reading from/writing into files then display appropriate user-defined message on screen (instead of Python's default error messages) describing what went wrong with more details about it so users can understand what went wrong? Do not use any print statements anywhere except where specified below because print statements will be used by graders for testing purposes only otherwise they will remove all print statements from your code before grading it so do not add extra",
