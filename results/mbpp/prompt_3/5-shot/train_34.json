We can move exactly n-1 steps from any cell in a row where n is the number of columns in a row. In the similar way, we can move exactly m-1 steps in any column where m is the number of rows in a column. We cannot combine steps of rows and columns (we cannot move n-1 steps in a row and then m-1 steps in a column). The distance between two cells is considered as 1. The diagonal moves are not allowed here. For example if we have 2 rows and 3 columns, then total possible moves are 3+2-2=3 only (right, down and left). If there are more than one possible paths with same cost then print any path you found first while traversing through all paths available to reach destination cell from source cell. If there is no path available to reach destination cell from source cell then print -1 as output. Assume that both source and destination cells are always non negative integers less than total number of cells present in matrix at any given point of time during program execution flow without worrying about overflow or underflow conditions for input values provided by user/caller function/main method to this function/method as input parameters or arguments at runtime during program execution flow for this problem statement here given above on this page under heading Problem Statement section above on this page.. This problem statement is also known as \"Rat In A Maze\" problem statement which was asked by many companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle etc during their software engineering job interviews conducted online or offline with some variations like having additional constraint condition like only left turn allowed at each step instead of right turn too along with left turn etc depending upon company who asked this question on their job interview round online or offline etc.. You can assume that maze will always have exit point i.e it will never be blocked maze which has no way out so you don't need to worry about that part.. Just assume that maze will always have exit point every time you execute your code for this question here on",
