If there are more than one such substrings of same length then return the first one. Consider that all letters are lower case. If no such substring exists then print -1. For example, if string is \"aabbccddee\" and k=3 then output will be \"aabbccddee\" as it has all 3 unique characters with length 11. Another example is \"abcbbcdbacbcd\" and k=2 then output will be \"bcbbcdbacbc\". Note that this problem is different from longest substring with atmost K distinct characters which can also be solved using sliding window technique. Here we need to find exactly K distinct character in the substring. This problem can also be solved using sliding window technique but here we need to use two variables to keep track of current window start and end indices respectively instead of just one variable used in many other problems like finding longest substring without repeating characters etc.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.
