Example: If the input is [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], then the output should be 2 as there are two consecutive ones. If the input is [0], then the output should be zero. If there are no consecutive ones in a given list return None. Note: The input can contain duplicate numbers and negative numbers as well. For example: [1, 0, 1, -1] and [0] are valid inputs. The output can also contain negative numbers; for example [-1] is a valid output as well. Return None if none of these conditions satisfy. For example: Input :[0,-1,-2], Output :None Note: Do not import any module and do not use any inbuilt function to solve this problem other than max(). Also note that you cannot use any global variable here too or else your solution might fail our internal test cases (which we will use while grading your submission). You may also try out different test cases by yourself before making your submission to check if your code works fine on them or not but make sure that it does not fail on our internal test cases otherwise you might lose marks on this question even though it passes all your own test cases because of failing our internal testcases which we will run while grading your submission which will have more testcases than what you tried out by yourself on your local machine). In order to submit successfully please make sure that you have uploaded only one file (your solution file) before submitting and that too without renaming it else it might fail some of our internal tests which will result in losing marks on this question even though it passes all the public tests which we run before accepting submissions from students so please take care about these things carefully before making a successful submission to us otherwise you might lose some marks even though you pass all public tests successfully but fail some internal tests due to uploading multiple files/renaming files etc which we run while grading submissions from students so please be careful about these things when making successful submissions to us).
