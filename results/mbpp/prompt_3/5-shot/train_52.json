It should return a tuple with two items: the first item being the number of lines and second item being the content of file as string. Use context manager to open and read the file. Make sure to close the file once you are done reading it. If an exception occurs during file operation, make sure to catch it and print appropriate error message and return (0,''). Ignore blank lines while counting lines in a text file and also ignore trailing whitespaces if any present at end of each line in a text file while calculating length of each line as number of characters in that line. Also ignore blank lines at end of text file if any present while counting number of lines in a textfile. Note that len() function can be used to calculate length of string but make sure not to use len() function on list or tuple data types as they have different meaning for len(). For example, len([1,2,3]) is 3 but len('abc') is 3 too which can lead to confusion if not understood well by beginners so avoid using built-in len() function on lists or tuples. Return (0,'') if filename is empty or None otherwise ignore other invalid inputs such as int/float values etc.. If you are using Python 2 then use xrange instead range for generating sequence numbers from 0 till n-1 where n is length returned by built-in len() function on list/tuple data types or returned by calling readlines() method on opened files object which returns list containing all non-blank lines from opened files object without trailing newline character '\\n' at end of each line except last line if it doesn't contain anything else but just newline character '\\n'. It's always good practice to handle exceptions immediately where they occur instead deferring them until later time when they may be forgotten about entirely so don't forget about handling exceptions when opening and reading files instead deferring them until later time when they may be forgotten about entirely so handle exceptions immediately where they occur instead deferring them until later time when they may be forgotten about entirely so don't forget about handling exceptions when opening and reading files instead deferring them",

Assume that the length of the given string is more than 1 and can be even or odd. In case of even length, we divide the given string into two halves and in case of odd length, we consider one character as middle element and divide the rest into two halves. The definition of palindrome is that when a string reads same from front as well as back if we consider space also as valid character. For example, \"abcba\" is palindrome but \"ab cba\" is not palindrome because space between 'a' and 'b' is not considered valid character while checking for palindrome condition. If given string \"abbac\" then minimum number of cuts needed to partition it such that every part becomes a valid palindrome are 1 cut at index 2 (0-based indexing). If given string \"abdbca\", then answer would be 3 cuts at indices 1, 3 and 4 (0-based indexing). If there exists multiple solutions then print any one solution will be accepted. Note: There may exist multiple answers for this problem statement so this code will work only if your answer matches with our expected output. You are required to complete get_min_cuts() function which takes two arguments - input string and its size and returns an integer denoting minimum number of cuts required to make each substring a valid palindrome or else return -1 if no such partition exists.. Also note that there are 2 test cases where you need to return -1 because no such partition exists which makes all substrings valid palindromes after cutting it at some index position.. The driver code prints the total number of partitions possible followed by actual partitions along with their corresponding indices where they are cut.. Constraints: 1 <= Length Of String <= 1000 Input Format: First line contains T denoting number of test cases . Each test case contains two lines first line contains N denoting length Of String And Next line contains N space separated characters denoting contents Of String Output Format: For each testcase , print in newline ,the",

Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a report by Goldstine and Neumann as early as 1948. Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows: Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted). Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list. The steps are: Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing 1 element (a list of 1 element is considered sorted). Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only 1 sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list. Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.
