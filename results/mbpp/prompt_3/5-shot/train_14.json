Return the length of the longest consecutive numbers sequence. You may assume that all the elements in the list are integers. If there is no sequence, return 0. The input list can be empty or contain only one element. In this case, return 1. For example, for [1, 2, 3, 4], you should return 4 because it is the length of [1, 2, 3, 4]. For [5], you should return 1 because it is a single number. For [1] or [], you should return 1 as well since they are also single numbers and sequences respectively. For [-2,-3,-4,-5,-6], you should return 5 since there is a continuous consecutive numbers sequence [-2,-3,-4,-5,-6]. The first number might be negative and/or larger than the last number in an increasing consecutive numbers sequence but not decreasing. You may assume that all elements in given input list will be unique (no duplicates). Note that if there are multiple sequences with same length but different starting point then we need to consider only one such sequence with minimum starting point as output from your program/function/method call).
