Also write the function to return the first pair of integers from the given list which gives maximum product. Note: The pair has to be formed by taking two different elements from the list and not by choosing same element twice. If there is no such pair in the given list then return None as answer. For example if input is [1, 4, 3, 6, 7] then output should be 42 as 42 is maximum product of any pair in the given list and (6,7) are those numbers which give 42 as their product. If input is [4, 4] then output should be None as we can't form any pair using two different integers from this list and also we can't choose same integer twice to form a pair. Please note that you should solve this problem with one single function i.e., your solution should have only one function definition for this question rather than having two functions for each part of question i.e., for finding maximum product and for finding first such pair respectively.(This solution will not get accepted if you have defined two separate functions). Also note that you can't use built-in max() or min() functions or similar built-in functions like sort(). You are expected to write logic for both parts of question on your own without using any built-in functions except abs(). In case you want to use abs(), please import it like \"from math import abs\". You may also use some constants like pi etc wherever required in your solution but don't hardcode these values in your solution without using them in computation otherwise it will lead to wrong answers being reported by our system during evaluation.(For example if you hardcode value of pi somewhere in your code without actually using it then our system will report wrong answer). Also note that even though we have mentioned about returning None as answer but we expect all other valid answers which are returned instead of None (like 0 etc) will get accepted by our system during evaluation so please don't worry about this point and",

For example, if we have a list [1,3,5,8,9,2,6,7] then it can be reach in 6 jumps (1->3->8->9->7). The function should take two arguments as input - list and index of starting position. If a starting position is not given then consider it as 0 (first position). If a list is empty or None then return -1. Note that you can jump only forward from your current position towards the end of the array/list. You cannot jump backward or skip any elements in between. Also note that you can only jump up to an element whose value is greater than or equal to your current element's value (i.e., you cannot jump over an element whose value is smaller than your current element's value). For example for input [4,2], index 0 output will be -1 since there is no way to reach 4 from 2 but if input was [4] and index 0 then output would be 1 since we can just directly go from 4 to 4 at cost 1 jump! You may assume that all elements in the array are non-negative integers and start <= end where start denotes starting index and end denotes ending index i.e., last element's index in given array/list.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.
