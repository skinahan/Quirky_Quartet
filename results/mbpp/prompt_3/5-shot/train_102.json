The string contains both uppercase and lowercase characters. Ignore all the white spaces present in the string. For example, for a given string \"The quick brown fox jumps over lazy dog\", it should return 36 (excluding all white spaces). The function should ignore case sensitivity i.e., consider both uppercase and lowercase characters as same character and count them once only. If there are no characters other than white spaces, then it should return 0. Note that capitalization does not matter here i.e., 'a' is considered same as 'A'. If there are no characters other than white spaces, then it should return 0. Also note that input can be empty or NULL or None or NoneType depending on your programming language of choice (for example, take care of following cases). If there are no characters other than white spaces, then it should return 0. Also note that input can be empty or NULL or None or NoneType depending on your programming language of choice (for example, take care of following cases).

The Levenshtein distance between two strings is defined as follows (Wikipedia): \"The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (i.e., insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.\" For example, if we have two words \"apple\" and \"abble\", then we can change \"apple\" into \"abble\" by inserting 'b', deleting 'p' or replacing 'p' with 'b'. Thus Levenshtein distance between these words will be 1 because only one operation needs to be performed on word1 i.e., either insertion or deletion or replacement operation will make word1 equal to word2 i.e., abble.\" Note that this problem can also be solved using dynamic programming technique which you might have learned in your computer science course but since this course focuses on algorithms rather than dynamic programming technique, we will solve it using brute force approach instead of dynamic programming approach here .
