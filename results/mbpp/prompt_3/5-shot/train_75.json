We will update start and max_len accordingly at each step while filling up this table using two nested loops below where j goes from i+1 till end of string (exclusive).

The solution should contain only unique strings as output without any duplicates or repetitions in any order/sequence or position within it.\n\n\tThe IPs should be returned in lexicographical order (sorted order). So if there are two possible IPs with same length, then sort them based on their first value and then second value and so on... For example - [\u201c1\u201d, \u201c2\u201d] < [\u201c1\u201d, \u201c20\u201d] < [\u201c10\u201d, \u201c2\"] < [\"10\", \"20\"] < [\"100\", \"2\"] etc... If you find two IPs with same values for all four parts but one has less number of parts than other then consider it as smaller than other one i..e [\"10\", \"20\"] is smaller than [\"10\", \"20\", \"0\"] because it has less number of parts i..e 2 compared to 3 here... If you find two IPs with same values for all four parts but both have different number of parts then consider lexicographical ordering as mentioned above i..e [\"10\", \"20\"] will come before [\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"], which will come before [\"1\", \"23\"].\n\n\tIf there are no valid ip addresses return an empty list [].
