The function should return an integer which is the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence. If there are multiple sequences with same length, return the first one encountered. The sequence must be strictly increasing and elements can only be added to one end of the sequence. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4] is a valid sequence but [1, 2, 4] is not. The input list will have at least one element and all elements will be positive integers. Do not use inbuilt functions such as sort() in your solution. Note that you are expected to write complete code as per instructions and you cannot make changes to given template code. Please read all instructions carefully before attempting this question! Do not modify names of variables/functions/classes already present in template code otherwise your submission will fail evaluation! You can create additional classes/functions if required but do not rename existing ones or delete them! Do not import any external modules (other than math module) as doing so may lead to failure at evaluation time! Do not use any global variables unless specified otherwise! Make sure that your code works on both Python2 and Python3 without any modifications! Your solution must work in linear time i.e., complexity should be O(n). For example if input list is [1, 3, 5] then output should be 1 because there are no consecutive numbers present in this list but if input list is [6, 7, 10, 11] then output should be 3 because there are three consecutive numbers present in this list (6 & 7) and (10 & 11). You can assume that input will always contain at least one element which has consecutive number(s). Hint: Use hash table for linear time lookups (lookup time for hash table is constant on average)! Hint: Use set instead of hash table for faster lookups (lookup time for set is constant)! Hint: One way to solve this problem would involve traversing through each element at least once so overall complexity would still remain O(n) after using hash table/set even if you traverse through each element again after constructing a hash",

If the given amount has profit then calculate its percentage profit. If the given amount has loss then calculate its percentage loss. Return -1 for invalid cases. (For example input is empty). Round off your answer to two decimal places and return it as string. If your answer is 231231.1415929, then return \"231231.14\" , No need to truncate it to six digits after decimal point, Return only two digits after decimal point, Even if the original answer is 231231.1415929000 , you need to ensure that we get only upto two digits precision after decimal point. You can use inbuilt functions of python to do this task or write your own logic to do this task.) For example :- if input list is [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695] then output should be \"Percentage of profit is 45.71 %\", similarly if input list is [100, 50 , 30 , 10] then output should be \"Percentage of loss is 66 %\", if input list is [100] or [] then output should be \"-1\" .
