The reduce() function accepts a function and a sequence and returns a single value calculated as follows: Initially, the function is called with the first two items from the sequence and the result is returned. Then, the function is called again with the result obtained in step 1 and the next value in the sequence. This process keeps repeating until there are items in the sequence. The reduce() Function can be imported like this - from functools import reduce. Use lambda functions wherever necessary to solve this question. Example: max_in_list([5,8,2]) Output: 8 Explaination: 5 and 8 are passed as arguments to max(). Max returns 8 as it is greater than 5. Now 8 and 2 are passed to max(). Max returns 8 as it is greater than 2 also (8>2). Finally, 8 is returned by max_in_list(). Note that only one call was made to max(). Hence this approach using reduce() is more efficient than using for loop or while loop when we need to find only one value like maximum or minimum from a list of numbers. You can read more about reduce() here - https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce . You can also try solving this question without using lambda functions but you will have to write additional lines of code which makes your code longer compared to solution with lambda functions which uses fewer lines of code but achieves same functionality as longer codes without lambda functions do!
