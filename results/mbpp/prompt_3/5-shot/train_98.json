The factorial of a number is the product of all integers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 is 1*2*3*4*5=120. You can assume that input to the function is always a positive integer. Hint: First try without using recursion and then using recursion. Also, write such that you can use this function in other programs by importing it as a module. Do not hardcode the value of 5 in your code. Use input() method to take user input from console and convert it into an integer using int(). If you are new to modules, check out this official tutorial first: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#importing-from-a-package\nTask: Write a python program to solve the above question by defining and calling appropriate functions as needed based on requirements mentioned above and below examples section. No additional comments and docstrings are needed beyond what is already given here or what will be provided by auto grader while evaluating your code submission for correctness against test cases.. Additional info: Pay attention to the datatype of input and expected output (if any). Is the input an integer? Is it an array? Is it a string? Use correct data structure to derive the needed answer based on constraints mentioned in problem statement above examples section.. Examples: Example 1 Input : 5 Output : 120 Explanation : Since 5! = 120 Example 2 Input : 6 Output : 720 Explanation : Since 6! = 720 Example 3 Input : 7 Output : 5040 Explanation : Since 7! = 5040 Answer: def factorial(n): if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1 else: return n * factorial(n - 1) num = int(input()) result = factorial(num) print(\"The factorial of\", num, \"is\", result) Question Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array where each element consists of X times 'X' string followed by Y times 'Y' string .",
