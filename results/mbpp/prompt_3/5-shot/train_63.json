The function should return the index of second smallest number from the given list. If there is no second smallest number then function should return -1. The index of first occurrence of the number in case of duplicates should be returned. Assume that all the numbers in the list are unique and there will be always a second smallest number. Use zero based indexing for your answer. Also make sure that you do not modify the input list during your solution. For example: if input_list = [4, 5, 1, 9] then output is 2 and if input_list = [4, 5, 9] then output is -1 . Indexing starts from 0 here as shown above. You can write additional helper functions if needed but do not modify the definition of function or its parameters and don't add any additional import statements to your code. Do not use built-in functions like sort(), min(), max() etc to solve this problem as they are prohibited for this task (use them after you have solved this question). Note that you can write helper functions which take input_list as parameter but do not modify it inside your helper functions as it's passed by reference and any modification will reflect in original list also (this happens because python passes mutable objects by reference). You can also write your own test cases for better testing or ask us to review your approach if you feel stuck at some point during solving this problem statement . We will review only those solutions which have been submitted by 11:59 PM IST on 21st May 2020 . Please note that we may choose to extend submission deadline due to certain unforeseen circumstances so keep an eye on course announcements section for updates regarding same . Good luck! Happy Coding! :)   Answer: def find_second_smallest(input_list): pass # Remove pass and enter your logic here # Test Inputs test_inputs = [[4, 5, 1, 9], [4], [5], [9], [-3]] expected_outputs = [2,-1,-1,-1,-1]",
