(Hint: Use datetime module and find difference between two dates.) The function should take two arguments and return the number of days between them. If an error occurs, it should return None. Note that you can use your own values for testing purpose. You can also see this link for more information about datetime module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html?highlight=datetime#module-datetime . The input will be in the format 'yyyy-mm-dd' and output will be an integer value representing the difference in days between the given dates (including both). For example, if date1 is '2018-01-01' and date2 is '2018-01-15', then output will be 15 as there are 15 days between these two dates including both start date and end date. Also, if any of the given arguments are not valid then return None as output instead of raising any exception or error message on screen (you can raise exceptions only during testing phase). You can assume that both input strings are valid ISO 8601 format dates with year range from 1000 to 9999 inclusive i.e., there is no need to check for leap years or invalid month values etc., but you have to check whether given day value is valid or not e.g., there are only 30 days in April, June, September & November months so you must handle those cases accordingly before calculating final output i.e., if day value exceeds maximum possible value for a month then simply set it equal to maximum possible value for that particular month). You can also see this link for more information about ISO 8601 standard format: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601 . Note that all test cases will be using valid inputs only i.e., there won't be any invalid inputs like negative year values or invalid month names etc., so you don't have to write additional code to handle those cases as well but your code must work correctly with such invalid inputs too without raising any exception or error message on screen during testing phase (you can raise exceptions only during testing phase). Also note that all test cases will have",

Ignore capitalization and punctuation. Assume that the text contains only letters, spaces, and punctuation marks. Return a list of the most common words in descending order of frequency, then alphabetically within frequency. In case of ties, use alphabetical order to break them. You can ignore all punctuation marks and special characters such as !@#$%^&*()_+= etc while counting words. Ignore those words whose length is less than or equal to 3 (e.g., the, an, a, to etc). Use Python built-in functions such as sorted(), list comprehension etc wherever possible for solving this problem. You can also write additional helper functions if you want but do not modify the signature of given function i.e., you are not allowed to change the name or number of arguments and their datatype of this function i.e., def find_most_common_words(text). You can assume that argument text will always be a string type object containing only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), spaces and punctuation marks but no numbers or any other special characters like !@#$%^&*()+_-= etc.)  Note: The output should be in lowercase with no leading or trailing spaces in each word e .g., ['hello', 'world'] instead of ['Hello', 'World']. Also note that your output should match exactly with expected output (order matters here) e .g., if expected output is ['hello', 'world'] then even ['Hello', 'World'] will give wrong answer because it does not match exactly with expected output i .e., it has different case for letters H and W as compared to expected output hello/world respectively so ['hello','world'] will give correct answer but ['Hello','World'] will give wrong answer.)\n\n  Task: Write a python function to solve the above question using following parameters -\n\n    filename - Name of file containing text data\n\n    topN - Number indicating top N most frequent words from file data\n\n    Additional info: Pay attention to the datatype of input",
