The given list contains names of Indian states and union territories. The output should be a single integer value. Note that the words can repeat or can be present in any order in the input list. Also, note that there is no need to use any other function except lambda, map and reduce functions. No need to import any module as well. Only these three functions are needed to solve this question using functional programming paradigm. This question will help you understand how lambda, map and reduce functions work together with each other for a given problem statement. Also note that there is no need to use regex here since we are not finding anything from a string but just finding some values from a list of strings by splitting them into words based on whitespace character between them (or even if you want you can use regex). So don't worry about regex here just focus on how these three functions work together to solve this problem statement without using any other function or module here except these three functions only. No additional comments and docstrings are needed here as well so don't write any comments or docstrings either which may give error while executing your code by the system while grading your assignment submission file (the online compiler will give error if it finds any comments or docstrings). So don't write anything except what is required by the question only without writing anything else which may give error while grading your submission file (your code). Also, remember that there is no need to take input as well since we already have an input data provided with this question itself which is mentioned below as sample input data for this question so just copy-paste it into your code editor and run it directly instead of taking input from user through some input() function call since we already have an input data provided with this question itself so no need to take user's input through some input() function call instead just copy-paste it into your code editor directly and run it directly without taking user's input through some input() function call since we already have an input data provided with this question itself so no need to take user's input through someinput()function call instead just copy-",
