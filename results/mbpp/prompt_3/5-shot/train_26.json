The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o' and 'u'. The substrings doesn't contain any of these vowels. The given string may contain any type of characters including capital letters, small letters, digits or symbols. You have to find the maximum number of substrings which contains only vowels and no other characters. Each substring must be unique and different from each other substring. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For example, \"hello\" is a substring of \"helloworld\". However, \"el\" is not a substring of \"helloworld\" because it is not contiguous with the other characters in the string. If there are more than one result with same length then you have to choose any one result from them as your answer. If there exist no such substrings then print -1 as output for that test case. For example, if you are given an input string \"hello world\", then you can split it into two strings as follows (\"hello\", \"world\"). Here the total number of valid substrings is 2 because both strings (\"hello\" and \"world\") contains only vowels ('e' and 'o') but they are different from each other so they won't overlap each other if we take them together as our answer so we can take both strings as our answer or we can take any one string among them as our answer, so here we can get two answers (\"hello\", \"world\") or (\"ello\", \"orld\"). So here your function should return 2 because there exist two non-overlapping substrings which contain only vowels in this input string but if you split this input into three parts like this (\"hel\", lo, world\"), then you will get three non-overlapping strings (\"hel\",\"lo\",\"world\") but all these three strings don't contain any vowel so in this case your function should return -1 for that test case because there doesn't exist such non-overlapping strings which contains only vowel in it otherwise your function should return 3 for",

The length of the list is (n-1). Example, [2,3,4,5] is a list for 5 numbers and 4 is missing in this list. The function should accept a list and returns the missing number. Note that you need to write complete code including definition and call of function. Use random module to create random lists and test your code by calling the function 100 times with different lists and print the output for all tests together using print statement. Your output should look like following (Note that you will get different values since it uses random module):\r   Missing number is: 1\r   Missing number is: 2\r   Missing number is: 3\n\n   Missing number is: 4\n\n   Missing number is: 5\n\n   Missing number is: 6\n\n   . . . . . . etc..

Additional info: Pay attention to the datatype of input and expected output. Is the input a tuple? Is the input a string? Is the input a matrix? Use correct data structure to derive needed answer. Also pay attention to other constraints such as memory usage, time complexity etc., while solving this problem. You can use standard libraries other than random module only if needed but do not copy paste from internet or any other source without understanding it properly since it will reduce your score significantly! If you use some algorithm or method from internet or any other source then make sure you understand it clearly before using it in your code! Otherwise use only basic python constructs without importing additional libraries/modules unless otherwise specified in problem statement! Also make sure your program runs without errors for all test cases! Hint: Think about how you can generate required lists using random module? How can you find missing element efficiently? What kind of data structure will be useful here? Think about these questions before jumping into coding solution!
