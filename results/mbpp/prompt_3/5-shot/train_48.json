The input list is in sorted order. The numbers are from 1 to 100. You can modify the given list. Note: If the search space is large, instead of using the whole list, it may be better to use binary search on a sorted array with length n+1 (with possible numbers from 1 to n+1). In this case, you should assume that there are no duplicates in this array and there will only be one missing number in this array. So you should return only one missing number instead of an array with multiple missing numbers.
