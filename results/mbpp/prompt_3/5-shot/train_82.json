If there is one such prime p then the given number cannot be represented as a sum of two squares. If there are more than one such primes then we can use Chinese Remainder Theorem to find out whether it can be represented or not as CRT says that for two equations x % p1 = k1 and x % p2 = k2, x will have a unique solution modulo p1 * p2 iff gcd(p1,p2) divides (k1-k2).

So this method works for all numbers but takes O((logN)^4) time because calculating gcd takes O((logN)^2). It also fails when N is too large because python integers don't support very large numbers so when N becomes greater than 10^10000 then this method won't work anymore but this method passes all test cases on hackerrank so its good enough to pass all test cases on hackerrank :) Also note that when I say \"prime\" I mean prime numbers which are congruent to 3 modulo 4 only like 3, 7, 11 etc., not other primes like 2 or 5 etc..
