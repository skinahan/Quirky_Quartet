The substrings may overlap or be contiguous(adjacent). The function should take two arguments as input and return one integer as output. In case of an error or invalid inputs you should raise an exception with an appropriate message. The exception should be defined as UserDefinedException. Also write the unit tests for this function with at least two different inputs and its respective outputs along with proper validation checks for all the test cases you have written. After writing the unit tests try to find at least one bug in your function by using those tests and then rectify it in your code and update your unit test accordingly so that they pass successfully after rectifying the bug(s). Also write another test case which confirms that you have successfully rectified your bug(s). You can use any existing Python framework of your choice (unittest, Pytest etc.) for writing test cases and running them against your solution code but make sure that you include all your test cases in a single file named \u2018TestSubstringCountingFunction\u2019 along with proper documentation for each test case using docstrings format so that it is easy for us to evaluate them without any hassle or confusion when we run them on our machines during evaluation of your assignment submission. Your solution code along with all its necessary imports/definitions should be present in a single file named \u2018SubstringCountingFunction\u2019 which contains only definitions/implementations related to this question and nothing else so that we can easily evaluate it when we run it on our machines during evaluation of your assignment submission without any issues or dependency errors caused due to multiple files/modules being present together as part of single solution submission for this question even though multiple files are allowed for submission but make sure that there are no import errors caused due to incorrect usage of relative path while importing modules from different files into each other within same project folder structure when we run them on our machines during evaluation of your assignment submission otherwise such submissions will be rejected",
