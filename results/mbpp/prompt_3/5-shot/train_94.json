The stock prices are given in the form of a tuple with the index of the tuple denoting the time of buying and selling. If no profit can be made, return 0. Also, you can only buy and sell once. For example, if input is (100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535), then output should be 525 (buying at 40 and selling at 535). Another example is (100), in this case output is 0 since there is only one element in input tuple. You can assume that input will always have at least one element and that all elements are integers. Also you can assume that all elements will be positive integers as well. You don't need to validate inputs or raise exceptions. So input like (), (), ('a', 'b') etc., should not be considered. In addition to this constraint on input format you may also assume that number of days for which stock prices are given will always be equal to 6 days i.e., length of input tuple will always be 6 (Note: This constraint has been added to make sure your code runs within time limits set for this problem). You may write additional helper functions as needed but do not change name of given function or write complete code in it instead of writing helper functions as required by question statement or definition provided for given function in this page because doing so will make automated evaluation fail for your code and you won't get any points even if your code outputs correct results for sample inputs shown on this page.. And please note that there are no constraints on memory usage i.e., you can use any data structure like list etc., without worrying about memory usage while writing your solution as long as it passes within time limits set for this problem during automated evaluation but please note that since we are using Python 2 language interpreter so list comprehension syntax like [x*x",

The total number of unique paths available are displayed as output. If there is no possible path, then display -1 as output. Note: The robot is moving either down or right at any point in time. So, it cannot go left or up from any cell. Also, it cannot go outside the grid boundaries and cannot move to cells which have 1 as their value in the input matrix mat[][]. The value 0 denotes that those cells are blocked and cannot be used for movement by the robot. It is assumed that all cells have value either 0 or 1 only and there will be no empty spaces between two consecutive rows and columns of values in mat[][]. The source cell has coordinates (0, 0) and destination cell has coordinates (m \u2013 1, n \u2013 1). Input Format:The first line contains an integer m denoting rows of matrix mat[][].The second line contains an integer n denoting columns of matrix mat[][].Each line after that contains space separated integers denoting elements of each row of matrix mat[][]. Output Format: Print a single integer denoting total number of unique paths available from source to destination if it exists otherwise print -1 as output without quotes where m denotes rows and n denotes columns of input matrix mat[][].
