No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nPay attention to the datatype of input and expected output. Is the input a tuple? Is the input a string? Is the input a matrix? Use correct data structure to derive the needed answer. The longest common prefix is defined as an initial sequence of characters that are common to all strings in a group of strings (usually an array of strings). The longest common prefix for an empty set of strings is defined as empty string, \"\". If there is no common prefix, it returns an empty string \"\". All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z only. Your function should not modify any elements in given lists or tuples while solving this problem, otherwise it will result in wrong answer even though your logic is correct . For example : Input : [\"flower\",\"flow\",\"flight\"] Output : \"fl\" Input : [\"dog\",\"racecar\",\"car\"] Output : \"\" Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings . Note that all given inputs are lowercase letters only . All elements in each list or tuple will be unique . (No duplicate) All lists or tuples will be sorted before passing as input . For example, [1,2] and [1,1] are different lists but [1,2] == [2,1]. So use sorted() for sorting when you pass them as arguments into your function , like this - min_heap_queue([1,2]) instead of min_heap_queue([1,2]). Otherwise you will get wrong answer even though your logic is correct . You can assume that every element in each list or tuple will be positive integer value only , so you don't have to check whether they are int values or not inside your function , like this - if type(element) == int: instead just do like this - if element >= 0: inside your function because there won't be any negative integers inside any list or tuple passed into your functions for solving these problems . You can assume that all inputs will be valid , so there won't be any None values passed into your functions for solving these",
