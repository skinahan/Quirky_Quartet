The input string contains a comma separated sequence of words. The output should be in the form of tuple containing the words that are present in the string. Each word is present in different lines and each line should contain a single word followed by newline character (\\n). Assume that there will be no punctuation marks or extra spaces within the words and that the output will always be valid python code. Also assume that there are no other special characters apart from alphabets, numbers and whitespaces within the string. Note: Refer to sample I/O for exact formatting of output. Sample Input #1: 'Hello World' Sample Output #1: ('Hello', 'World') Sample Input #2: 'Geeks for Geeks' Sample Output #2: ('Geeks', 'for', 'Geeks') Sample Input #3: 'I love Python' Sample Output #3: ('I', 'love', 'Python') Task Write a python function to solve the above question.

Is the input a matrix? Use correct data structure to derive the needed answer.\n\n    The median is defined as follows for an even number of elements: The median is equal to the sum of two elements divided by two, i.e., med(a1,a2,...,an) = (a(n/2)+a((n/2)+1))/2 . For example, med(1,3,5) = 3 . For an odd number of elements: The median is equal to exactly one element in sorted order (elements are sorted from lowest value to highest value), i.e., med(a1,...an) = ak if n+1 is odd where k=(n+1)/2 . For example, med(3) = 3 , med(3,5) = 3 , and med(-10,-8,-6,-4,-2) = -6 . Your solution must work for both cases (odd and even).\n\n    Hint : Use list slicing concept here.(https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/list/sort).\n\n    Note : Do not use any external packages or libraries for this question other than standard library packages like math or sys or os or re etc..

No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nPay attention to the datatype of input and expected output. Is the input a tuple? Is the input a string? Is the input a matrix? Use correct data structure to derive the needed answer. And also pay attention to whether you have to modify or return new list (or tuple). If you need new list, use slicing or other techniques instead of modifying original list (or tuple). If you need to modify original list, then don\u2019t use extra space like creating new lists (or tuples) etc., which may change your complexity of solution from O(n) to O(n^2). For example, if you are asked for in-place modification of original list, then don\u2019t use slicing technique like mylist[:] = [x for x in mylist if x not in seen]. It will change your complexity from O(n) to O(n^2). Instead use del operator like del mylist[i]. It will keep your solution complexity as O(n). Though it is not recommended in general coding practice but for this question it is ok because it is very clear that we have been asked for in-place modification only. So be careful about this kind of things while solving questions on this platform and also during interviews too! Good Luck! :)\n\n  def remove_duplicates(input):\r\n\n    output = []\r\n\n    seen = set()\r\n\n    for value in input: # Don't want dupes in key\r\n\n        # add to seen list after first occurrence found\r\n\n        if value not in seen:\r\n            output.append(value)\r\n            seen.add(value)\r\n\n    return output   # Return resulting array without dupes  */  */   /*/*/*/*/ /*/  /*/ /*/ /*/ /*/   ////////*/*/*//**/**//*//*//*/**/**/*/**/*/**/*/**/*/**/** ** ** ** /*****/** /** /** /** /** /** *** *** *** **** **** **** **** **** * * *",
