The function should take two arguments (list, n). Where n is the size of the list. If n is not provided then it should take the length of the list as n. The function should return an integer value which is the sum of all even numbers in that list. If there are no even numbers in that list then it should return 0. Please do not use any built-in python functions to solve this question. Note: Use dynamic programming approach to solve this question and write down both top-down and bottom-up approaches for this problem statement in your answer file (you can use additional files also). You can assume that all elements are positive integers only. Also, you can assume that there will be no duplicates in the input array/list. Here are some examples:   Assume variable a holds [1,2,3,4] Then: sum_of_evens(a) returns 6 (because 2 + 4 = 6). sum_of_evens(a, 2) returns 2 (because 2 = 2). sum_of_evens(a, 3) returns 6 (because 2 + 4 = 6). Assume variable b holds [5,6] Then: sum_of_evens(b) returns 12 (because 6 + 6 = 12).

Return 'None' if no repeated characters are found. Ignore the case of characters while comparing them. Also ignore whitespaces while finding the first repeated character. If there are more than one repeated characters, then return the first repeated character that appears in the string. For example, if the input string is \"Python\", then it should print 'P', but if input is \"Java\" then it should print 'None'. Also, if input is null or empty, then it should print 'None'. If there are more than one repeated characters and all of them appear before another character which is not repeating anywhere in the string, then also you need to consider only that first repeating character and ignore other repeating ones. For example, if input is \"PHP Tutorial\", then it should print 'P' as this is the first repeating character that appears before any non-repeating characters (other than whitespaces). Note that we need to find only those repetitions which appear before any non-repeating characters (other than whitespaces). For example, for input \"Java J2EE Java JSP J2EE\", it should still print 'J' because though there are two 'J' s but second one comes after a non-repeating character ('2'). Similarly for input \"Python Python Python PYTHON pythoN\", it should still print 'P' because though there are four repetitions of P and three repetitions of N but second P comes after a non-repeating character ('y') and fourth N comes after another non-repeating character ('o'). Similarly for input \"a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\", it should still print None as none of these characters repeat anywhere before any other non-repeating character (other than whitespace).
