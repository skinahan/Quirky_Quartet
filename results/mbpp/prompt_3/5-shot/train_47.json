If there are no words repeated, return -1. Ignore case sensitivity while comparing the words. If multiple words are repeated, return the first word from the string. The words are separated by single space and punctuation is ignored (\u201chello\u201d and \u201chello,\u201d are same). Assume that the given string contains only alphabets and spaces (' '). Punctuations like ('{', '}', ',', '.' etc.) should be ignored while finding the first repeated word. Also assume that there will be only one space between two consecutive words. The output should not have any trailing or leading white spaces. For example: \"Raja went to market\" should return \"went\" as it is the first word which repeats in the string whereas \"Raja went to\" should return -1 as there is no repeating word in this string. Note that we need to ignore punctuation marks like comma (,) while finding a repeating word in our case \u201cRaja went to market\u201d should be considered as \u201cRaja went to market\u201d not as \u201cRaja went to ,market\". Also note that we need not consider any other characters like $ etc., since they don't repeat within a single sentence but can repeat across sentences e.g.: \"$he sells sea shells on sea shore\" has two occurrences of 'sea' but they occur across sentences so they shouldn't be considered for this question but if our input was \"$he sells sea shells on sea shore.\" then it would have one occurrence of 'sea' which occurs within a sentence so it should be considered for this question). Also note that we need not consider any other characters like $ etc., since they don't repeat within a single sentence but can repeat across sentences e.g.: \"$he sells sea shells on sea shore\" has two occurrences of 'sea' but they occur across sentences so",

The output should be sorted alphabetically. For example, if the input is 'ABC', then the output should be ['ABC', 'ACB', 'BAC', 'BCA', 'CAB', 'CBA']. You can use any language of your choice (but preferably Python/R). Also, write a test case for this function. Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in functions for this question. Please write your own logic and test cases for it. This question is worth 20 points and will be graded manually by our team. So please submit only the answer in text format (no need to submit zip or rar files) as an answer to this question on EdX platform with proper indentation and comments wherever necessary. Also, you can assume that the input string will contain only capital letters (A-Z). If you have any doubts regarding this question, feel free to contact us on edx@greyatom.com or ask your doubts on our forums page on edX platform (https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:GreyAtom+DS101+2T2019a/discussion/forum/i4x-Engineering-GreyAtom-DS101).
