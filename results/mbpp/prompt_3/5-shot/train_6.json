A simple solution is to one by one consider all sub-strings of first string and for every sub-string check if it is a substring in second string. Keep track of the maximum length substring. There will be O(m^2) sub-strings and we can find whether a string is substring on another string in O(n) time (See this for KMP based method for substring search). So overall time complexity of this method would be O(mn). We can use Dynamic Programming to find the longest common substring in O(m*n) time. The idea is to find length of the longest common suffix for all substrings of both strings and store these lengths in a table. The longest common suffix has following optimal substructure property: If last characters match, then we reduce both lengths by 1 and check family tree again. So the length of LCSsuffixes (or LCSsuffixes[i][j]) = LCSsuffixes [i+1][j+1] + 1 if X[i] = Y [j], 0 otherwise Note that the rows and columns are initialized with 0s firstly, so when there is no matching character between X[0..i] and Y [0..j], LCSuffixes [i][j] = 0 Finally we traverse the table to get maximum value which will be our result. Note that there might be more than one solutions with same maximum value, this function prints any one of them.*/ Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.* No additional comments and docstrings are needed.* Additional info: Pay attention to the datatype of input and expected output.* Is the input a tuple?
