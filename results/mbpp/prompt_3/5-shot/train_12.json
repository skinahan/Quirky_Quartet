Use heap queue algorithm. Return the top-k elements in descending order. If top-k is greater than the length of the given list, return all elements in descending order. If k is equal to 0, return an empty list. Note that input could be any iterable type such as tuple and string. Also, you are not allowed to use built-in methods like sort(). In case of a tie, choose the smaller element first. For example: if input is [3, 1, 2] and k is 2 then your function should return [2, 3]. If input is [3, 1, 2] and k is 4 then your function should return [2, 3]. If input is [3, 3], and k is 2 then your function should return [3].

The length of the list is not known. You can assume that the numbers are in range [0, 100]. We also know that there will be no more than 10 numbers in the list. Use a variable-length argument to solve this problem. Your function should return -1 if we pass an empty list as an input argument. Note that you are not allowed to use any built-in functions or modules (like numpy, pandas). Also, you are not allowed to use any control structures like if-else or for/while loops. Use only pure functional programming concepts and data structures available in Python 3.x to solve this problem. You can call your function as follows: mean([10, 20]) # 15 mean([5, 10, 15]) # 10 mean([5]) # 5 mean([]) # -1 Note that you should round off your answer and then cast it into int before returning from your function because all test cases have been designed such that they expect integer values as outputs only! Also note that you need to write recursive functions only; no iterative functions are allowed here! Do not use any external libraries or built-in modules like math and statistics here! If you find yourself using any such module/library here then please undo those changes before submitting your code for grading! Hint: You may want to define an inner helper method here; but we leave it up to you on how exactly do you want to approach this problem! Feel free to discuss with your peers about this problem by posting on Piazza; but remember not share any code or solution there! Please note that Piazza discussions will be taken into account while evaluating peer evaluation scores at the end of the term! Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.
