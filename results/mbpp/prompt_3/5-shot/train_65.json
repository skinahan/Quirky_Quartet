A matrix is said to be a sparse matrix if there are more than half of the elements as zero. For example, the following matrix is a sparse matrix. The number of zeroes present in this matrix is 8 which is more than half of total elements (9). Hence the output will be True. If we take another example where there are three zeroes and six non-zero elements then it will not be a sparse matrix as it does not satisfy our condition that number of zeroes should be greater than half of total elements (9).

The matrix can be of any size. Examples are given below. The first example is a 3 x 3 matrix and the second one is a 5 x 5 matrix. The third example is a 2 x 4 matrix and the fourth one is an empty list. You can assume that the input will be always square matrices (n x n). For example, [[1,2],[3,4]] is not a valid input because it's not square ([2x2]).\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Just write your code inside this editor window and run it by clicking on \"Run\" button which appears at the top-right corner of this editor window when you click on it. To run your code press \"Shift+Enter\". This will execute your code and show you any errors or warnings if there are any in your code. Pressing \"Shift+Enter\" again will re-run your code even if there were no errors or warnings in it previously (this might be useful when you make some changes to your code after running it once). You can also use keyboard shortcut \"Ctrl+Enter\" to run your code without saving it first (in case you don't want to save it before running). If everything goes well then output will appear as shown below each question after pressing \"Shift+Enter\". Please note that only last line of standard output should be printed by you otherwise nothing will appear as output since we are using multi-line input boxes for showing examples in these questions which means that anything printed before last line won't be visible as output even though there would be no error or warning shown by IDE but still nothing will appear as output since we are using multi-line input boxes for showing examples in these questions which means that anything printed before last line won't be visible as output even though there would be no error or warning shown by IDE but still nothing will appear as output since we are using multi-line input boxes for showing examples in these questions which means that anything printed before last line won't be visible as output even though there would be no error or warning shown by IDE but still nothing will",
