The Newton\u2019s method is based on the following observation: if y is an approximation to the square root of x, then y/2 will be a better approximation. The idea behind this method is to start with some arbitrary value for y and then iteratively improve it by taking the mean of y and x/y. This process will converge towards the correct result as x approaches zero. For example, if we start with y = 1, then we get successively better approximations of 1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12,... . A complete description can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method#Square_root_of_a_number .\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question with appropriate docstrings and comments wherever necessary. No additional comments are needed in docstrings and code comments are not needed at all. There should not be any magic numbers used in your code except for specifying number of iterations in range(). You can use math library functions like sqrt() but you cannot use built-in functions like pow(). If you want to use any other modules or libraries that are not provided by default with python3 installation you need to install them separately using pip or conda commands before importing them into your code for execution purpose only! You need to provide proper validation for all arguments passed into your function so that it does not fail under any circumstances from user end! Your solution must work for all possible inputs without failing! You must write at least two test cases using pytest framework (one positive case and one negative case) before submitting your solution file! Your test cases should pass without any failures before submission else your submission will be rejected immediately! The pytest framework ensures that all test cases defined by you are executed successfully without failures before submission time else it rejects your submission immediately! Please read more about pytest here: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/. Also watch this video tutorial series on youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tzf4W65oJtM&list=PLkz1SCf5i",
