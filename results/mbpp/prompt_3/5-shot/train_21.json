Also write the time complexity for your code. Assume that the maximum and minimum element would be unique in the BST. If there are more than one such elements, print any one of them. Do not use any global variables or attributes of root node to solve this problem. Do not modify the original tree structure as well. You may assume that it is a valid BST with unique values in each node of the BST. You can create a new class Node for storing values if needed. The time complexity should be O(h) where h is the height of given binary search tree (BST). Assume that h <= 10^5 for 50% of test cases and h <= 10^6 for remaining test cases where h is height of given BST to pass 100% test cases on our online judge platform against brute force solution which has O(n) time complexity where n is number of nodes in given BST. For example, consider below two trees T1 and T2 with five nodes each:\n\n         5                  5           \n\n        / \\                / \\          \n\n       3   8              3   8         \n\n      /   / \\            /     \\        \n\n     2   6   9          2       9       \n\n                                         ...and so on...
