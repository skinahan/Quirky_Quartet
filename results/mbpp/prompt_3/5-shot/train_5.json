If not, return False. If yes, return True. The given integer can be negative also. For example, 8 is a power of two, but -8 is not a power of two. Similarly, 64 is a power of 2 but -64 is not a power of 2. Note that 1 and -1 are not powers of 2 as they are neither positive nor negative numbers. Also note that any number 0 or any negative number respectively, is also not considered as an answer for this question as per definition in mathematics and hence should be returned as False for both cases (0 and negative numbers). For more information on this topic refer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_two#Fast_algorithm_to_check_if_a_positive_number_is_.28or_.29a_power-of-two . You can use built-in functions like log2() from math module to solve this problem by using logarithmic identity which states that x is a power of y if y = logb(x). Where b here denotes the base which in this case would be 2 since we are checking only for powers of two here i.e., 2^x where x can be any real number including zero or even negative numbers like -4 or 0 etc., But again note that 0 and negative numbers should be returned as False as per our problem definition above stated in the first paragraph itself i.e., \"Note that 1 and -1 are not powers of 2 as they are neither positive nor negative numbers\". Also note that you cannot use built-in functions like pow() from python's standard library to solve this question since it would give wrong results when used with large integers such as 1234567891234567891234567891234567891234567891234567891234567899876543210123456789876543210123456789098765432101234567564321012345675643210123456756432101234567564321012345675643210123456756432011111100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011111111111111111111111111111000000000000000000000000000000000002222",
