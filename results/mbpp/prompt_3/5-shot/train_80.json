If the number is prime, then it is considered as its own largest divisor. Otherwise, print -1. Return the result in tuple format. Note that the order of elements in the output tuple should be same as input list. If no such element found then return (-1,-1). For example, if input is [3] and [2], then output should be (3,-1) and (2,-1) respectively. This can be done by using zip() function and converting to dictonary using dict(). Then convert it into list using list().

The same pair should not be counted twice. Also, elements of the array cannot be repeated (i.e., if an element appears more than once, it should only be considered once). For example, if there are 5 elements in the array and 3 pairs whose sum is equal to 12, then your program should return 3. If there are 4 pairs that have a sum of 12, then your program should return 4 even though we are counting some pairs twice. If there are no such pairs in the array, then your program should return 0. You can assume that you will only get valid inputs: arrays will contain at least 2 elements and all numbers will be positive integers (greater than 0). Do not use any built-in Python functions or data structures like lists or dictionaries to solve this problem. We will see these data structures later in this course and they may help make your code simpler but they cannot be used here because we want you to practice using arrays and indexing into them (these concepts are very important!). You may assume that each element of the array is unique; you do not need to check whether each element appears more than once in the inputted array. Do not change any inputs or print anything out from within your function; just return an integer value as described above based on what you find from processing the inputted arrays as described above. To make it easier for us when testing your code and grading it, please follow these requirements exactly so we can easily test whether it works correctly or not! Hint: Think about how you would solve this problem by hand if you were given two lists on paper with numbers written on them and needed to count how many times two numbers add up to another number when crossing off one number at a time from each list! What would you do? How would you keep track of which numbers have already been crossed off? How would you know when you had found all possible combinations? What kind of structure could help keep track of which numbers have already been crossed off? Can an array work as such a structure? Why or why not? If yes, how can an array work as such a",
