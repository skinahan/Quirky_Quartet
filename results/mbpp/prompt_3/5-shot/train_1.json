If there are no second largest elements, the function should return False. The list contains both positive and negative numbers. The function should ignore the repetition of numbers and negative numbers. For example, if the input is [2, -2, 2], it should return -2. If the input is [10, 5, 10], it should return 5 because 10 is repeated twice and hence not considered as second largest element. The length of given list can be less than or equal to 3. For example if input is [3] or [3, 3], it should return False since there are no second largest elements in such cases. If input is [3, 4] or [-4,-4,-4], it should also return False since there are no second largest elements in such cases as well (since all three numbers are same). Note that an empty list will never be passed to your function so you don't have to check for an empty list as well (because that's already taken care of by the problem statement). You can assume that number of elements in a given list will always be greater than or equal to 2 and less than 100000 (100K). So you don't need to worry about handling lists with only one element as well as lists with more than 100000 elements either (because those cases are already taken care of by problem statement). Also note that your function doesn't need to print anything like we have been doing so far in the course; it needs to just return some value which depends on whether any two distinct elements exist whose difference is minimum or not (as explained above) based on what's been explained above about how this question has been worded and what kind of inputs you can expect from us when we test your code after you submit your solution for this assignment question on our end during evaluation phase after this assignment deadline ends later today at 11:59 PM IST tonight.. You just need to write logic inside your function definition which achieves what's mentioned above based on what's written above about how this question has been worded and what kind of inputs you can expect from us when we test your code after you submit your solution for this assignment question on our end during evaluation phase",

The order of result list should follow the occurrence of elements in the original list. Consider duplicates are unique if they appear only once. If there is no such element return an empty list. For example, if the input is [1,2,3,2] and [3,4], then output should be [1, 2]. If there are no such elements return an empty list. Note that this problem is different from finding the intersection of two lists which will have only one copy of each element present in both lists. Here we need to find all elements even those which are present only once and not common to both lists. The order of result list should follow the occurrence of elements in the original list (or second given list). For example, if input is [1,2,3] and [4], then output should be [4]. If there is no such element return an empty list. Note that this problem is different from finding union of two lists which will have all unique elements present in both lists but with duplicate occurrences as well (like 1 has occurred twice above). Here we need to find all unique elements even those which are present only once and not common to both lists but without any duplicates at all (like 1 has occurred only once above). The order of result list should follow the occurrence of elements in either one or other or both original lists depending on whether it's a union or intersection problem respectively as mentioned above. For example if input is [1, 2] and [3], then output for union should be [1 ,2 , 3] while output for intersection would be [] since there's no common element between them at all! \n\n Task: Write a python function to solve the above question using lambda expression and filter() function along with any other needed functions/methods like reduce() method from functools module as well!
