The order of elements in list should not matter, i.e., (a, b) = (b,a). Return an empty list if there are no such pairs. If there are multiple solutions return all possible solutions in ascending order of indices from first list and ascending order of indices from second list within each solution tuple pair. So, if first solution is (2, 3) then second solution should be either (3, 2) or (4, 1). Assume that both lists have unique elements and can contain duplicate values too. Both lists can be assumed as sorted as well but it is not mandatory for solution set. You can use built-in functions or write your own code without using any built-in library functions for sorting purpose only but you cannot use any built-in library functions/methods for finding pairs whose sum is equal to given value x within given two lists l1 and l2 respectively otherwise you will get zero marks for that test case even though your overall score may be more than 50%.

The function should return the sum and the sublist containing the maximum sum. If multiple sublists have same maximum sum then return any one of them. The sublist should be in continuous order. For example, if input list is [1, 2, 3], then output should be (6, [1, 2, 3]), but if input list is [3, 2, 1], then output can be either (6,[3,2,1]) or (6,[2,1]). The solution should work for negative numbers as well. For example [-2,-3,-4] should return (-2,[-2]) as -2 is largest negative number present in the list. If all elements are positive integers then an empty list can be returned as shown below for input [10].
