For example, if list1 = [1, 5, 8] and list2 = [6, 7, 1], then your function should return True as both lists have 1 in common but if list1 = [2, 6] and list2 = [4], then your function should return False since both lists do not have any common member. Note that you are allowed to modify any temporary variable(s) you may use in your solution but you cannot modify either of lists passed as arguments nor can you append/add items into them directly or indirectly from within your solution code without using built-in functions like append/extend/insert etc., which is not allowed in this exercise). Also note that you cannot convert either of list into other data structure like dictionary, set etc., which is also not allowed in this exercise).
