If there are multiple elements that appears maximum number of times, return the smallest number. If there is no element that appears more than once, return -1. Note that all the numbers are positive integers and greater than 0. Do not use any sorting functions or built-in functions in python to solve this question. For example: If the input is [3,3,3,1], your output should be 3 and if input is [3], your output should be -1 (as there is no element that appears more than once). Note that this question can be solved using defaultdict from collections module but you have to write it without using defaultdict class from collections module. Do not use any other libraries or built-in functions other than those which are imported by default in python environment. You can assume that you have only positive integers as inputs and greater than zero as well. Also do not use any sorting functions or built-in functions in python to solve this question. Please note that you need to write complete code as per given instructions with necessary arguments/parameters along with returned value/output datatype specified in the question description above.. Do not include main function or code for calling your function as part of answer code submission.. Also do not include any additional comments or docstrings inside answer code submission.. For example: If the input is [3,2,1], your output should be 3; if input is [3], your output should be -1 (as there is no element that appears more than once); if input list has duplicate elements such as [2,2] then smallest among them will be returned i.e 2; if input list has duplicate elements such as [5,5] then smallest among them will be returned i.e 5; if input list has duplicate elements such as [-8,-8,-8,-9] then smallest among them will be returned i.e -8 etc..
