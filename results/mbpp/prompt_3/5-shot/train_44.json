Assume that the comment indicator is #. The result should be returned as a list of tuples (directory, file, number of lines). If a directory is empty or no python files are found, it should not be included in the result. The directories and file names should be sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive). The result for a specific file should contain the total number of non-empty and non-comment lines. For example consider this directory structure: dir1\\file1.py dir2\\file2.py dir3\\file3.py dir3\\dir31\\file4.py The output with root_dir = \"C:\\temp\" would be [(\"C:\\temp\\\\dir1\", \"file1.py\", 4), (\"C:\\temp\\\\dir2\", \"file2.py\", 0), (\"C:\\temp\\\\dir3\", \"file3.py\", 2), (\"C:\\temp\\\\dir3\\\\dir31\", \"file4.py\", 1)] Note that we are not looking for Python code complexity metrics here but only for comments and empty lines (lines containing only whitespace characters). For example if file1 contains print(\"Hello World\") #This is a comment line then it has 4 non-empty and non-comment lines (the last one being commented out).
