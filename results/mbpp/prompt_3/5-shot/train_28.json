Use correct data structure to derive the needed answer.     In this problem, you will be required to use nested for loops (i.e., one loop inside another loop). You may also use some built-in functions like zip(), enumerate() etc., but only if you need them as part of your solution (do not use them just to avoid writing loops). You may also use other functions which you might have written yourself earlier as part of this problem set or any other problem set earlier in this course or elsewhere (but make sure that they do not solve this task directly). If you are stuck with this question, we recommend that you try breaking it down into smaller parts/subproblems and solve each subproblem individually until you put together all subproblems to arrive at an overall solution to this problem (in case you need help with breaking down problems into subproblems, refer here ). Hint: Try comparing characters at corresponding positions in two strings and see how it helps in solving your current problem . Also note that as soon as one character mismatches between two strings , there is no point continuing with comparing further characters from those strings since we know that there won't be any common prefix after those mismatching characters . Finally note that once one character mismatches between two strings , we can move on to compare first character from next string with first character from first string since we know there won't be any common prefix before first character from next string .",
