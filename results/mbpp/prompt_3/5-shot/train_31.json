The elements of the list are distinct. If the size of the given list is less than two, return -1. Return None if the input is not a list.

What will be your approach if you have to find out third largest number? What will be your approach if you have to find out kth largest number?

Handle all errors and exceptions raised by python built-in functions like indexing errors, value errors, type errors, key errors etc., Test your code with various edge cases before submission on edX platform so that it does not fail any test case during evaluation on edX platform due to any logical error in your code.

The length of the list must be greater than or equal to 2. The function should return None if there is no second largest number present in the given list. Return None, if the given list is not a valid input or it has less than two elements. If there are multiple such elements in the list, then apply max() method only on those elements and then sort them and return the second highest element from that sorted list using sorted(). Do not use any built-in methods/functions for sorting or finding maximum/minimum values. Note that you can use built-in functions for other operations like append(), len(), remove() etc., but do not use any built-in functions related to sorting or finding maximum/minimum values (max() and min()) . You can assume that all non-negative integer values will be present in the given list i.e., do not consider any other data type like string, boolean etc., while writing your solution code. Also note that your function should work with negative integers also; it should be generic enough. Do not write separate functions for handling positive integers and negative integers separately as it will affect your score negatively when we test your code with different inputs during evaluation..\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.
