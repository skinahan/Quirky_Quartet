The input string can contain special characters and numbers. The function should return a tuple with two integers, first integer is the count of vowels and second integer is the count of consonants. Return (0, 0) if both are zero. Both returned integers should be in lower case. The output tuple should be ordered as vowels followed by consonants. For example, if input string is \"Infosys Mysore 570027\" then output should be (6, 10) because there are 6 vowels and 10 consonants in this string ignoring special characters and numbers. If there are no vowels or no consonant then return appropriate value as 0 or 1 respectively. Do not use any built-in functions or libraries for this problem except for string library functions to check if a character is alphabet or not using isalpha() method which returns true if character is alphabet otherwise it returns false as shown below:   >>> ch = 'A'   >>> ch.isalpha()     True   >>> ch = '$'     >>> ch.isalpha()     False   Note that uppercase alphabets are also considered as lowercase alphabets here e.g., 'A' == 'a'. Also note that we need to consider both upper case and lower case alphabets here so you need to do some type casting here before calling isalpha method e.g., chr(ord('a') - 32).isalpha(). This will convert lowercase alphabet into uppercase alphabet before calling isalpha(). You can use ord() method to convert character into ASCII value and vice versa using chr() method as shown below:    >>> ord('a')    97    >>> ord('A')    65    >>> chr(65)     'A'   Tip: You can iterate through each character of a given string using for loop as shown below:       str = \"Infosys Mysore 570027\"      for c in str:           print c            I          n          f          o         ",
