The keys in the dictionary are numbers and values are strings. Return the maximum and minimum value as a tuple with respective key. If there is more than one maxima or minima, then return all maxima or minima as a list of tuples with respective keys. Return an empty list if there is no maximum or minimum value in the given dictionary. Note that you can assume that all values of dictionary are unique strings. Also, you can assume that all keys will be positive integers only (no zero or negative integers). For example, if dict_var = { 1 : 'a', 2 : 'b', 3 : 'c', 4 : 'd' }, then your function should return [(4, 'd'), (1, 'a')] for maxima and [(2, 'b'), (3, 'c')] for minima. You can write additional helper functions if needed but do not modify the signature of given function. Do not use any built-in functions to solve this question. You may use your own custom sorting algorithm to solve this question but you cannot use any built-in sorting functions like sorted(), sort() etc., If you have written any helper functions in Python language then you must declare them as global variables inside main(). Otherwise they will be treated as local variables by judge's code and it will throw runtime error during grading because those global variables don't exist locally in judge's code environment due to scope limitations of Python language itself. Also note that your main() should be able to call/invoke your custom sorting algorithm without passing any arguments like lst = my_sort() where my_sort is name of your custom sorting algorithm which does not take any argument but returns sorted list lst after performing its operations on global variable var which contains unsorted list data read from input file by judges code environment before calling/invoking main() function defined by user inside solution submission file (.py). Do not modify/delete these lines written below in this template otherwise it will show runtime error because those lines are required for auto-eval",
