The function should take the file name as an argument and return the length of the longest line. If there is no such line, then it should return 0. If there are more than one such lines, then it should return the length of first such line. Ignore all empty lines and comment lines from your code logic. Also ignore all leading and trailing white spaces from each line while calculating its length. Ignore case sensitivity i.e, consider upper case and lower case characters as same while comparing strings for equality check. For example, if below is given input file (input1), then your function should return 7 as output because 'is best' is 7 characters long string which is longest non-empty string without any leading or trailing white space in this file ignoring all empty lines and comment lines from your code logic: # This program is to find out longest non-empty string in a given file input1 = ''' This program is to find out longest non-empty string in a given file # Comment 1 IS BEST ''' Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.

The order of elements in the output should be preserved. If there are no duplicates, return the original list. You can assume that all input values are integers or characters. For example, [1, 1, 2] returns [1, 2]. Similarly ['a', 'a', 'b'] returns ['a', 'b']. If there are no duplicates, return the original list. For example, [1, 2] returns [1, 2]. Similarly ['a', 'b'] returns ['a', 'b']. Note that you can not use functions like set() or sorted(). You have to implement this on your own and then call it from a function called remove_duplicates(). This is because we want to test your ability to write custom functions and call them from another function. Do not manually iterate through each element of the given list and check for duplicates. Use looping constructs provided by python like while or for loops etc., The solution should be generic enough so that it can work with any data type (integer or character). For example it should work with both lists like [1, 1] and ['a', 'a'], without explicitly checking for their data types in our solution code. Hint: Use dictionary data structure to solve this problem efficiently without using any additional datastructures/functions as mentioned above (set(), sorted() etc.,).
