The input number will be less than 1000. The function should return an integer value. If the input is not an integer or if it is not less than 1000, raise a ValueError exception. You can use the following code snippet to test your program. You can assume that the input will be always less than 1000 and greater than 0. It will never be zero or negative value. If you want to test your code by passing zero or negative values, you may use try-except block in your code to handle such cases gracefully and print appropriate error messages on screen for such inputs (you are not required to do this extra part but it would definitely help you in understanding exceptions). Also note that the solution does not need any external library imports. Also note that for this question, we are only interested in finding out whether your program works as per specifications and not about how fast it runs (i.e., even if it takes 5 minutes for your program to run, as long as its output is correct, you will get full marks). So optimize only after you have got all tests passing successfully first! This question has some hidden test cases which are used during evaluation of your submission and those hidden test cases may include inputs with large numbers (greater than 1000) too so make sure your code works fine for any integer input greater than zero! Here is how sample runs of testing should look like: $ python3 factorial_last2digitstestcase1input5expectedoutput20actualoutput20testcase2input100expectedoutput25actualoutput25testcase3input200expectedoutput81actualoutput81testcase4input500expectedoutput75actualoutput75testcase5input1000expectedoutput25actualoutput25alltestspassedsuccessfully! # Your program begins here# Your program ends here To run the above code snippet on command line terminal, please save the above code snippet into a file named factorial_last2digitsTestCase1Input5ExpectedOutput20ActualOutput20TestCase2Input100ExpectedOutput25ActualOutput",
