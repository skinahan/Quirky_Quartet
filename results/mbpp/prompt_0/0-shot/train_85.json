No additional docstrings are needed and you can assume that the value of pi is 3.14. Round your answer to two decimal places. Also write a python program to test your solution by passing different values for the radius and check the output with expected output. The perimeter of a circle is 2\u03c0r where r is the radius of the circle and \u03c0 is pi which is approximately 3.141592 . For example if r=2 then perimeter = 2*3.14*2 = 12.56 . Hence if r=2 then your function should return 12.56 . You can use round() method to round off to two decimal places in python as shown below: print(round(1256/100 , 2)) #Outputs 12.56 . Note that we divide by 100 because we want two decimal places after rounding off so we divide by 100 and not 10 as you might have expected! Also note that this method rounds off to nearest value so there may be cases when your answer may be slightly more or less than expected but it will be within 0.01 of correct answer! For example if you pass 0 as input then correct answer should be 0 but yours may be slightly higher or lower than zero which will still pass this test case because it will still be within +-0.01 range from zero! So don't worry about exact values here! Just make sure that rounded value returned by your function is within +-0.01 from correct answer! Test cases: Note that all these test cases are provided only for testing purpose and these are not exhaustive tests so don't worry about other test cases or edge cases!
