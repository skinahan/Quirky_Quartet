You can also use the <code>all()</code> function to avoid writing the loop yourself. It takes an iterable and returns <code>True</code> if all elements are truthy. Here's how you can use it: \n<code>return all([x in tup2 for x in tup1])</code>. This will work with any iterable data structure that supports membership testing (<code>in</code>) like sets or lists.  If you want to make it more efficient by using a set instead of a list then you can do this: <code>return all({x for x in tup1} &lt;= {x for x in tup2})</code>. This will be faster because lookup time for sets is O(1) compared to O(n) lookup time for lists. Also notice that I'm creating a set from each tuple before doing the comparison so that I don't have to create new sets inside the loop every time which would be wasteful. You could also do this with <code>(set(tuple), set(other_list))</code>, but then you'd have to convert your tuples into lists first which defeats the purpose of using tuples at all (tuples are immutable).  One more thing - if either tuple has duplicate items then these solutions won't work as expected because they'll think that duplicates are separate items and thus check them separately when really they're just one item repeated multiple times. To fix this problem we need to create counters instead of sets like so: <blockquote><pre><b><i><font color='green'>from collections import Counter</font></i></b><br/>...<br/><b><i><font color='green'>def is_subset(tuple_a, tuple_b",
