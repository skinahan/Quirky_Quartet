No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nThink along the lines of the variables and data structures that need to be used. Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures.\nAnswer:",

In short it merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array in O(length) time complexity where length is the length of both arrays combined together. This function takes three arguments : The first argument is the first list which needs to be merged with second list which is passed as second argument and third argument specifies the length of both lists combined together i.e., length=len(a)+len(b). The reason why we are passing third argument instead of simply calculating it in this function itself by adding len(a) + len(b) because it would add up to time complexity which we don't want since our objective is to solve this problem in linear time complexity i.e., O(length). Using an additional variable for storing value that can easily be calculated inside this function doesn't add up to space complexity but using an additional variable for storing something that can easily be calculated inside this function adds up to space complexity so we don't want that either because our objective here is also not only solve this problem but also solve it with",
