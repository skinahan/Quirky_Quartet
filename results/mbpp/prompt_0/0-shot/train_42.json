This matches any word boundary that is not at the beginning or end of the string, and then matches a <code>z</code>.

We want to make sure that our pattern occurs somewhere in the string, so we don't need to search for it; we just need to make sure it's there somewhere! If we used `re.search`, then it would find patterns even if they were only part of another word! For example, `re.search('zz', 'foo zzz bar')` would match because part of our pattern (<code>zz</code>) occurs within another word (<code>zzz</code>) even though none of our patterns occur by themselves as words!
