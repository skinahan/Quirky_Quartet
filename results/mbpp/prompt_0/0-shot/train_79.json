This would be slightly more efficient than your <code>for</code> loop since it stops as soon as it finds a pair that's not increasing.   It's also more concise.   If you wanted to get really concise, you could use the \"scholar's nightmare\" idiom:  <code>(lambda x: all(a &lt; b for a, b in zip(x, x[1:])))(data)</code>.  This is just like the previous solution except that it uses an anonymous function (the lambda) to make sure that the argument name doesn't conflict with any other variables.   You can also use this idiom if you want to avoid creating extra variables but still want to use intermediate results (e.g., if you wanted to find the indices of pairs of non-increasing numbers).     The downside of this approach is that it tends to be hard for humans to read.   In particular, it makes the code hard to debug because there are no named variables or functions involved.   So I wouldn't recommend using this version unless you're writing code golf or something like that.
