Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures.\nAnswer:",

For example if func is len then length of each word will be taken as key and words with same length will be clubbed together into one list under that particular key (length). In this way we can group all words having same length under that particular length which acts as our key here. Thus all lists containing words having similar lengths are grouped together under their respective keys (lengths).\n\n        return dict(d)   # returning the grouped dictionary created above using return statement which converts it back to normal dictionary format from default dict format used above for creation of lists inside dictionaries.
