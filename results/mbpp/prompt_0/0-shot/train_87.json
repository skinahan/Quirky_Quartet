No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nThink along the lines of the variables and data structures that need to be used. Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures. You can use math module for this question as well as for previous questions too (if you want). You can refer here for more details on cmath module of python, which provides access to mathematical functions for complex numbers (https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmath.html). The polar() function converts from rectangular coordinates (real and imaginary parts) to polar coordinates (magnitude and phase angle). The phase angle is given in radians if degrees is False or degrees if True, when available, otherwise it is given in radians with full precision regardless of degrees being True or False; degree mode is not supported by all platforms or versions of Python, so don\u2019t depend on it being present! The magnitude may be negative if x < 0; use abs(z) to get its magnitude without regard for sign! If z = x + yj then r = abs(z), phi = atan2(y, x) where atan2() computes an arc tangent of y / x in the range [-pi, pi] radians (-180\u00b0 <= phi <= 180\u00b0); note that atan2(0, 0) yields 0 rather than an error condition! Note that cmath module needs to be imported before using any functions from it as follows: import cmath . You can refer here for more details on math module of python (https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html). For example math returns nan instead of raising ValueError exception when trying sqrt(-1), while cmath raises ValueError exception instead of returning nan . Also note that you need not worry about these exceptions while solving these questions because we will not test your code with such inputs which would raise exceptions like ValueError , ZeroDivisionError etc., but still you should keep them in mind while coding because they might occur if you try your code outside this toolbox and hence your code should be able handle them gracefully without crashing!

Use set() function for this task and do not use any additional variables or data structures to solve this task. You can assume that there are no nested lists inside the input list and that all elements in the input list are hashable objects (i.e., they can be used as keys in dictionaries). Also, you can assume that there are no duplicate elements in the input list, i.e., all elements in it are unique objects with respect to equality comparison operator == . Note that you should use set() function only once for each element in the input list and it should be used on each element only once, i.e., do not use it twice on any element or more than once on any element inside your solution code! You can also assume that there is at least one unique element inside the input list, which means that if you apply set() function on an empty list then it will raise an exception! Your solution code must be able to handle such case correctly! For example, if your solution code calls set() function inside its body then it should catch any exceptions raised by this call and handle them correctly! If you cannot find how to catch such exceptions then please ask your instructor about this topic before submitting your assignment! Otherwise, you will lose points for such incorrect behavior of your solution code! To summarize all these requirements again: use set() function only once for each element in the input list and do not call it twice on any element or more than once on any element inside your solution code; also make sure that your solution code will work correctly even if there is an empty input list; finally make sure that if set() function is called somewhere inside your solution code then its exceptions will be handled correctly by catching them properly using try-except blocks around such calls! Task: Write a python function to solve the above question with additional requirements described above using only built-in functions without importing anything from external modules like math or random , etc.;",
