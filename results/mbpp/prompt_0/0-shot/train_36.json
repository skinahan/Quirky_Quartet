The function should take a list as input and returns the average.  The function should not raise any exceptions. If the input is an empty list, it should return 0. If there are any non-numeric values in the list, they should be ignored and not included in the calculation of average.  For example, if you call this function with [1,2,'a',3] then it should return 2 and not raise an exception or print an error message.   If you call this function with [1,2,'a',3,[],4] then it should also return 2 because 'a' is non-numeric but [] is numeric (it's zero).   Make sure you test your code thoroughly before submitting it for grading!   Hint: Use isinstance() to verify that each element of your list is numeric.  See https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesnumeric for more information on how to test whether something is numeric or not!   Also see https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_isinstance.asp for more details on how to use isinstance().   You can use float() to convert things like strings into numbers so that you can add them together and get their average!   For example float('1')+float('2')=3 . Note that float('a') will throw an exception so make sure you don't try converting anything that isn't numeric!     Also note that if x=[] (an empty list), then len(x)==0 . Finally note that sum([])==0 .     Your code will be tested against several different types of inputs so make sure your code works for ALL cases before submitting it for grading!  Test your code by running this cell below after replacing <YOUR FUNCTION NAME> with your actual function name!      In particular we will test whether your code raises exceptions when it shouldn't or doesn't raise exceptions when it shouldn't by calling your functions with various types of inputs including empty lists and lists containing non-numeric values such as strings or other lists!

If there is no profit, then return -1. \nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info: \nThink along the lines of the variables and data structures that need to be used. Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures. This problem can also be solved using recursion, but it is not mandatory here. You can use any method you want to solve this problem. However, you will have to write an additional script file (in Python) for solving it recursively and submit both files as part of your solution submission on EdX portal. The file names should be q2_maxProfit_recursive and q2_maxProfit respectively (in case you are submitting both files). The recursive version will not be graded but will help you understand how recursion works in Python with respect to dynamic programming problems like this one. If you do not wish to submit your recursive version, simply name your script file as q2_maxProfit only (and not q2_maxProfit_recursive). This is a simple coding question without any test cases or docstrings/comments required in your solution script file on EdX portal submission page for this question.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",
