He wants the groups to be as evenly sized as possible. For example, if the class has 12 students, then the teacher would divide them into groups of 4. If the class has 14 students, then the teacher would divide them into a group of 4 and two groups of 3. The teacher can only group students together if they are sitting next to each other in the classroom. Given a list of student seating arrangements, determine how many different ways that there are for dividing up the students into three groups (ignoring order). For instance: [1, 2, 3] is equivalent to [2, 1, 3]. The following two arrangements are equivalent: [1, 2] and [2, 1]. There is only one way to divide up these three students (1 + 2 + 0). There are two ways to divide up these four students (2 + 1 + 1 and 1 + 2 + 1).  There are three ways to divide up these five students (3 + 0 + 2 , 2 + 0+ 3 , and 0+3+2).  In this case there is only one way to group them together because they must all be grouped together since they\u2019re already sitting next to each other. There are four ways to divide up these six students (3+0+3 ,0+3+3 ,0+6+0 ,and 6+0+0). Task: Write a python function that takes in a list containing student seating arrangements as described above and returns an integer representing how many different ways that there are for dividing up those N number of students into three groups such that each group contains at least one student. No additional comments or docstrings should be included along with your function defintion. Additional info: Think about how you want your code organized before you start writing it down on paper or on your computer screen! Also think about what data structures you\u2019re going to need in order for this problem statement/question/task/function definition whatever you want call it!
