I would only add a comment on the last line. It's not obvious that the <code>max</code> function returns 0 when <code>dp</code> is empty. A better alternative would be to use the built-in function <code>max</code>. You could also add a check for an empty list of pairs at the beginning of your function, but it's not necessary.  I think this is enough to get an interview with Google :).  Good luck!
