It looks for one or more spaces that are preceded by a space and followed by a space, and replaces it with a single space.

There are however a few things that can be improved:\nDon't import everything from a module.  Import only what you need, in this case <code>re</code>: <code>import re</code>.  This will make it easier for you to spot when you are using a function from another module, as opposed to from the standard library.  It also makes your code more portable because it doesn't depend on modules that might not exist on other systems.  It's also less confusing for other people who read your code because they know exactly where each function comes from, instead of having to look up each one in the documentation or source code of the importing module.   (This isn't really an issue here because <code>re</code> is part of Python's standard library.)   See PEP8 - Imports for more information about this convention.   You should also avoid wildcard imports in general, see Why is \u201cimport *\u201d bad? and Why is using `from module import *` bad practice? .   In particular, if you have multiple modules that both define a function called <code>remove_spaces()</code>, then importing both will cause an error when you try calling one of them without specifying which one you want.    If there are multiple functions with the same name in different modules, then it's important to specify which one you want so that your program does what you expect it do do instead of something else entirely by accident!     (This may seem unlikely but it happens all the time.)
