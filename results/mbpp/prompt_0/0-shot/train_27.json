Complete the function simpleArraySum in the editor below. It must return the sum of the array elements as an integer. simpleArraySum has the following parameter(s): ar: an array of integers Input Format: The first line contains an integer, , denoting the size of the array. The second line contains space-separated integers representing the array's elements. Output Format: Print the sum of the array's elements as a single integer. Sample Input 0 6 1 2 3 4 10 11 Sample Output 0 31 Explanation 0 We print 31 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 10 + 11 = 31 . Task Write your code here Code Lockers Problem Statement: There are n students in a class, each having different roll numbers from 1 to n and all are assigned with lockers in school such that every student is having one locker and every locker is assigned to one student only (No sharing). The problem is that if any student forgets their locker number then they can ask their friend for it but if all their friends also forget then they have to ask every other student in class for it which will take time and hence they will be late for next period so you need to help them by assigning each locker with unique password which is nothing but cube of their roll number so that when someone asks for password you just need to tell them cube root of password which will be nothing but roll number and hence they can easily open their lockers without wasting any time or asking anyone else about it . You are given with n (1<=n<=10^5 ) , value denoting number of students in class , now your task is to assign unique passwords to all lockers such that when someone asks for password you just need to tell them cube root of password which will be nothing but roll number . Input Format First line contains single integer t denoting number test cases . Next t lines contains single integer n denoting size of class . Output Format For each test case print n space separated positive integers denoting passwords assigned to lockers respectively . Constraints 1 <= t <= 10^5 1 <= n <= 10^5 Example Input 5 5 6 7 8 9 10 Output 125 216 343 512 729 1000 1331 1728 2197 2744 3375 Explanation Test Case",
