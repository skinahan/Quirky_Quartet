For example if we have 8%3 = 2 then 9%3 = 0 and 10%3 = 1 etc. Similarly 15%2 = 1 so 16 % 2 = 0 and 17 % 2 = 1 etc. So basically for every multiple of (x+y) after (x+y) , there will be one extra value that satisfies the given condition i.e., modulo operator returns y. So for every multiple of (x+y) after (x+y), there will be one more possible solution to our problem i.e., one more possible value of k that satisfies our condition i.e., modulo operator returns y . Hence using recursion we can find out all these multiples of (x + y ) after ( x + y ) which are also solutions to our problem until a point when adding another copy of ( x + y ) does not yield any new values that satisfy our condition i.e., modulo operator returns y . This happens when adding another copy of ( x + y ) yields a number which is less than or equal to zero or when it becomes equal to zero . In either case it means that adding another copy of ( x + y ) does not yield any new values that satisfy our condition i.e., modulo operator returns y . This means all possible solutions have been found out and hence no further recursion needs to be done at this point since no further recursions will yield any new solutions at this point onwards since adding another copy of( x",
