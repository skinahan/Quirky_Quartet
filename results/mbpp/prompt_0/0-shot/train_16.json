The only difference is that we need to find the number of ways to reach a particular point in 2d plane instead of finding the number of coins required.\nThe idea is to use dynamic programming. We define an array dp[i][j] which will store the number of ways to reach (i, j) from origin. This array can be represented as:\n<code>dp[0][0] = 1\ndp[1][0] = 1\ndp[2][0] = 1\n... and so on till dp[d-1][0]. \n</code>\nNow for any point (x, y), we can reach it from either its left or top element depending on which one is possible. Thus, for any point (x, y), we have:  <code>dp[x][y] = dp[x - 1][y] + dp[x][y - 1];</code>  where <code>(x &gt; 0 and y &gt; 0)</code>. We can also use modular multiplication if there are overflow problems with large numbers. For example, if modulo value be m then: <code>dp[x][y] %= m;</code>. Also note that since we need only the number of ways to reach a particular point and not all possible paths, so using memoization will be more efficient than recursion here as it will reduce time complexity by avoiding recalculations for common subproblems. Also note that this solution is similar to nth fibonacci series problem but with two variables instead of one variable in case of fibonacci series.
