Output should be 15. \n</code>\n\n\nA:\n\n\nThere is no need for a recursive approach here, you can just use simple algebraic manipulation to find the answer. For example, if we take a look at the first few nonagonals (starting with <code>1</code>) we get: <code>[1, 5, 9, 13, 17]</code>. If we add 4 to each of these numbers in turn we get: <code>[5, 9, 13, 17]</code>. If we add another 4 to each of these numbers in turn we get: <code>[9, 13, 17]</code>. This continues until eventually you reach the last number in your list and then you have to repeat this process again starting with the first element of your list (which is now <code>9</code>) and add 4 each time until you reach your desired value. So what does this tell us? Well from this pattern it looks like there are four sets of four numbers that increase by four each time before repeating again from the beginning with an offset of one place from where it started before. This means that our equation will be something along these lines: \\$\\text{answer} = \\text{input} + \\lfloor\\frac{\\text{input}}{4}\\rfloor\\$. We can use integer division (<code>//</code>) in Python instead of floor division (<code>math.floor()</code>) so our equation becomes \\$\\text{answer} = \\text{input} + \\frac{\\text{input}}{4}\\$. You could also write this as a function where you pass an input and output parameter which would allow you to calculate any nonagonal number given its position or vice versa. Here is an example implementation using both methods described above: \n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 def nonagonal_number_for_position(position):\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"\"\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Returns a nonagonal number given its position\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 :param position: The position for which you want to find a corresponding nonagonal number\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 :",
