(If you do mean that it is not permitted to add any comments or docstrings to the code, then I think this is a really bad idea.)  But here's my answer anyway. :-)  My first thought was to do something like this:\n<code>def get_adjacent_coordinates(coordinate):\n\n    x = coordinate[0]   # The x-axis value of the given coordinate.\n\n    y = coordinate[1]   # The y-axis value of the given coordinate.\n\n    return [ (x + 1, y) , (x - 1, y) , (x, y + 1) , (x , y - 1) ] # Return a list of tuples containing all adjacent coordinates to the given one.\n\n                                                                  # NOTE: This list will include duplicates if there are any adjacent coordinates that have identical values for both their x and their y axes!  For example: If the given coordinate is (-2,-2), then this function will return [(-3,-2),(-3,-2),(-1,-2),(-1,-2)].  If it is important for your program that there be no duplicates in this list then you should use a set instead of a list for storing these values before returning them!\n</code>\nBut I thought about it some more and realized that <code>(0)</code>, <code>(0,)</code>, <code>(0,[])</code>, <code>(0,[],{})</code>, etc would all be considered valid input by my function above but they are not valid coordinates at all!  So I decided to add some validation code just in case someone accidentally passed such invalid input into my function... But then I realized that even if someone did pass such invalid input into my function by mistake they probably wouldn't want an exception raised because of it; they would probably want an empty list returned instead so they could handle the problem gracefully with an appropriate error message or whatever else might be appropriate in their",
