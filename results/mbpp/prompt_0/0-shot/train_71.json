Answer: def max_of_two( x, y ): if x > y: return x return y def max_of_three( x, y, z ): return max_of_two(x ,max _ two (y ,z))  #### Question: Given two lists of integers write a python function that returns True if one list is a subset of another list else returns False Task : Write a python function to solve th e above question . No additional comments and docstrings are needed . Additional info : Think along th e lines o f th e variables and data structures that need to be used . Also think about th e way t o access th e elements in th e data structures . Answer : def checkSubset (l1 ,l2): for i in l1 : if i not in l2 : re turn False re turn True #### Question : Given two lists of integers write a python function that returns True if one list is a subset of another list else returns False Task : Write a python function t o solve th e above question .

You may use multiple cells as needed. You may also use print statements to debug your code while you develop it. However make sure that these are removed before submission as we will test your code by calling this function with different arguments without using print statements. Also do not hard-code any values for variables or constants in your solution as we will test your code by passing different values for these variables/constants at runtime and expect your code to work correctly with any set of inputs it is provided with at runtime. \n\n          ## Answer: <pre>def sumlist():   #function definition</pre>                                                                  <pre>     num = int(input(\"Enter how many elements you want:\"))</pre>                                                       <pre>     print ('Enter numbers in array: ')</pre>                                                                        <pre>     for i in range(int(num)):</pre>                                                     <pre>         n = input(\"num :\")</pre>                         <pre>         list1=[]</pre><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><center></center></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>\"#\"#\"#\"#\"#\"#\"\"#\"\"###\"\"##\"\"###\"\"####\"\"\"####\"\"\"####\"\"\"####\"\"\"####\"\"\"####\"\"\"###\"\"##\"\"###\"\"##\"\"###\"",
