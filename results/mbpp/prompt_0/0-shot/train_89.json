This will multiply all the numbers in a list together. You can add additional logic to handle lists of strings and None values, but I'll leave that up to you. \n<code>def consecutive_multiply(l):\n\n    if not l: #empty list, return 0 as the product of nothing is 0    \n\n        return 0\n\n    #multiply all numbers in the list together and return the result\n\n    total = 1    \n\n    for i in l:      \n\n        total *= i        \n\n    return total  \n</code>\n",

It is a built-in function that returns a single result from performing an operation on all the elements of an iterable. For example, you can use it like this: <code>reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, [1, 2, 3])</code>. It will return 6. You can read more about it here. So your code could be written like this: <code>return reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, l)</code>. Also you can use <code>functools.reduce</code>, which is a bit faster than built-in one (see the link above). But the difference between them is small and I think it doesn't matter. If you are interested in performance of different solutions then you can check out this article by Raymond Hettinger (one of Python core developers). It's very interesting!  \n",
