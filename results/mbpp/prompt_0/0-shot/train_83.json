The recursive approach is more elegant though!\n\n \n\n \n\n     # Question 3 - MapReduce (5 points)\u00b6 In this question, you will use mapreduce framework using mrjob package (https://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/) installed in your virtual machine to solve simple problems using MapReduce paradigm. Please note that mrjob is not available on Windows machines, so we have set up a Linux virtual machine for you with all necessary software installed on it so that you can do your homework on it without having any setup issues on your own machines (Windows or Mac). There are two ways for you to access this virtual machine remotely from your own machines as follows: Using SSH client such as Putty or MobaXterm on Windows or built-in Terminal app on Mac OS X and Linux systems Using VNC client such as TightVNC viewer or RealVNC viewer You can find detailed instructions about how to connect this virtual machine from your own machines here . After logging into your VM via SSH or VNC, open up a terminal window and type jupyter notebook . This should open up Jupyter Notebook server in your default web browser where you should be able to access files under /home/ubuntu directory including this assignment file which is named homework2-<your uniqname>.ipynb . You may edit and run code cells inside Jupyter Note",
