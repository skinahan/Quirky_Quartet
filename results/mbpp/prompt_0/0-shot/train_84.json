Make sure its indented properly. You may use other functions as well. You can use the built-in function filter() to iterate over all the elements in the range 1 to n and filter out only those that are prime numbers. The function filter() takes two arguments, a function and a sequence type object like list or tuple etc. It returns an iterator that constructs a list from those elements of the sequence for which the function returns True. The syntax is - filter(function,sequence). Refer to documentation for more details on this topic. For example, list(filter(lambda x : x%2==0,[1,2,3])) will return [2]. Here lambda x : x%2==0 is an anonymous function that returns true if its argument is even and false otherwise (i.e., it filters out odd numbers). The second argument [1,2,3] represents a list of elements to be filtered out by this anonymous function.) Using this knowledge write your code below. Use the variable sum_primes to store the sum of all prime numbers between 1 and n (both inclusive). Return this variable from your method once you have computed it using appropriate logic inside your method below which uses higher order functions like map() or filter(). Remember to convert any iterable returned by map/filter into a sequence type object like list/tuple etc before returning them back as shown above with examples for lambda expression and map(). Also remember that map() applies its first argument on all items of its second argument (a sequence type object) one at a time and returns an iterator over these results instead of actually constructing them all at once as we did with lists in our previous examples in class or on Moodle page so you need to convert these iterators into lists using appropriate conversion functions like list(). Lastly note that you can also use reduce() along with map/filter but make sure you import reduce from functools module before using it as shown below - from functools import reduce .
