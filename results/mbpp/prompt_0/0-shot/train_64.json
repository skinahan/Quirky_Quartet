Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures.\nAnswer:",

There's also no need to create a new variable here, you can just modify <code>l</code>.   For example:  <code>l = [x for x in l if x != l[0]] + [l[0]]</code>.   I would recommend using your solution though as it is more readable and easier to understand.  If you're concerned about the performance, you should profile your code and optimize accordingly (if necessary).  As always, premature optimization is the root of all evil.   You can read more about this here: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity . Also keep in mind that Python has built-in functions for shifting elements around in lists such as pop and insert (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html).  It may be worth looking into those before implementing anything yourself (unless you're doing this for practice or fun).    \n",
