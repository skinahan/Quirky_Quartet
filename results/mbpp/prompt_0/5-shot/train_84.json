The longest common subsequence is the sequence of characters that appear left-to-right in both strings. If there are multiple LCSs of the maximum length, then print any one.  For example, consider the two given strings \"acdfg\" and \"acefg\". The LCS is \"acfg\", which has length 4.  Another LCS is \"aceg\", also of length 4. There are several other subsequences with this length, but none with more characters.  Note that an empty string is considered a subsequence of any string, and a string (even one consisting only of a single character) is considered a subsequence of itself.  A string s1 can be transformed into another string s2 by deleting zero or more characters from s1 and/or inserting zero or more characters anywhere into s1 to get s2; e.g., \"\" \u2192 \"abc\" \u2192 \"abcd\". The cost of transforming s1 into s2 using this operation is |s1| + |s2| where |s| denotes the number (or size) of characters in s; e.g., |\"\"| = 0 and |\"abc\"| = 3 . This cost function may be used to measure how similar two strings are to each other: if they have an LCS with maximum possible length, then their similarity score will be high; otherwise it will be low (more details below).  You must implement an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to solve this problem that runs in O(mn) time where m and n are the lengths of the two given strings respectively. You may assume that m \u2264 n \u2264 1000 . Print just one line containing one integer denoting the similarity score between these two strings according to this metric; i.e., print just one number whose absolute value represents how similar these two input strings are according to this metric described above: if they have an LCS with maximum possible length, then their similarity score will be high (close to 0); otherwise it will be low (far from 0).
