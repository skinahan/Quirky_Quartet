For example, the longest substrings with 2 unique characters are \"deabc\" and \"cabc\". The answer is \"deabc\". If there are multiple answers, then print any of them. If there is no such substring print empty string. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. The given string contains only lower case letters from 'a' to 'z'. It may contain duplicates characters and can contain at most k unique characters. The length of given string 'n' is in range [1, 10^5]. If there are multiple answers then print any of them. Note that input strings are passed as character array not as strings. So you can modify input strings also in your function. You need to return the output substring (string). Do not print anything in the function just return the value as specified above. You do not need to create any class or object or even import anything just write your logic and return the output accordingly as specified above it's very simple! No need to worry about this part! Just relax! This problem has been asked in Amazon interview recently so it might be asked again! So prepare well for this question!

If multiple elements are the most frequent then return any one of them. The array is guaranteed to have at least one element. For example, given an array [1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1], you should return either 1 or 3 as both are the most frequent elements and they have equal frequency. The array may contain multiple copies of an element. For example, given an array [1, 3, 4, 1], you should return either 1 or 4 as both are the most frequent elements and they have equal frequency. The array may contain negative numbers. For example given an array [-2,-3,-4,-2], you should return -2 as it is the most frequent element in this case. Note that it is possible for a number to be its own mode if it occurs more than all other elements in a set of numbers with equal frequencies (i.e., when two modes exist). For example given an array [0] your function should return 0 (as there's only one value in this case). If there are no modes then your function should return None/null/Nothing (depending on your language). The input will always be valid (non-empty) and will always contain at least one value that appears more than once (unless it's [-2,-3,-4,-2] which has two modes but only one value). You can assume that there will never be zero or negative frequencies and that all values will be non-negative integers less than 2^31 - 2^16 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^5 + 1 = 2147418112 inclusive (except for [-2,-3,-4,-2]). This limit exists because Python uses a 32 bit signed integer to store its integers internally so any number larger than this would cause problems such as overflow errors or incorrect results due to precision loss when performing mathematical operations on them; see here for more information about why this limit exists and how it works internally: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13795758/why-does-python-have-such-a-small-maxint .
