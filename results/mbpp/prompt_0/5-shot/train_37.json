Return an empty list if N is greater than the length of the given list or if N is negative or zero value. For example: [1,2,3,-1,-2,-3] and N = 3 returns [-1,-2,-3]. Also write the pytest test cases to test the program. Do not use any in-built functions/methods for sorting/heap queue operations to solve this question except heap queue algorithm functions available in python library (heapq). Use only basic data structures such as lists and tuples along with heap queue algorithm functions to solve this question instead of using complex data structures like dictionaries and sets which are not allowed for this question . Hint: Think along the lines of converting a given list into a heap queue using heappush() function available in python library (heapq) before applying nlargest() function on it to get largest N elements from it in ascending order as output as required for this question . You can also use heappop() function available in python library (heapq) on it after converting it into a heap queue to get smallest element from it but that is not required for solving this question . Please go through documentation of these functions before attempting this question . These functions are already imported by default while evaluating your answer so you need not import them again while writing your code . Also please note that you need not modify existing import statements present when you attempt this question since they are needed for evaluation purpose only . You can use additional import statements if needed but please make sure that only these two functions (heappush(),nlargest()) are used anywhere inside your code including within other user defined functions present there since any other usage will result in evaluation error during grading process due to security reasons . You may also add additional helper user defined functions if needed but please make sure that they don't call each other recursively since recursive calls will lead to exceeding maximum recursion depth limit resulting into runtime error during grading process due to security",
