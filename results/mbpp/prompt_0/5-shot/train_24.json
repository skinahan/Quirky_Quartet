The height of the empty tree is 0 and the height of tree with only one node is 1. Height of left and right subtrees of a node differ by at most 1. If there is more than one node in the tree and if the height of left subtree and right subtree differ by more than 1 then it is an invalid BST. Assume that data values are distinct positive integers. Return -1 for invalid BSTs.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Also make sure that your code works for multiple test cases by hard-coding them in the program itself or reading from input file/standard input or command line arguments/environment variables as applicable for your programming language choice (e.g., Python). You may assume that input format will be such that there will be no ambiguity about which number goes where in the binary search tree representation e.g., (2 (7 (2 None None) None) (6 (5 None None) (11 None None))) represents a valid BST while ((2 7 (2 () ()) 6 ((5 () ()) 11 () ()))) does not represent any valid binary search tree because 5 comes before 2 although 5 > 2 according to BST property because it is present in right sub-tree rooted at 6 which comes after 2 in this case.. The output should contain exactly one integer i.e., height of given binary search tree or -1 if it represents an invalid BST as explained above.. Note: Please make sure you do not print anything other than what is expected/asked in problem statement as output format matters too! Also please do not modify any existing code present in template section or default code stubs provided as part of question unless absolutely necessary as doing so may result in loss of points even when your solution works correctly otherwise! No marks will be deducted for using additional imports but you should limit your use to standard libraries only unless explicitly allowed otherwise",

Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures. You can also assume that both lists will have only integer values, no float or strings etc..., so you can perform direct addition without worrying about typecasting or string concatenation etc.., just like how we add two numbers without worrying about their types in mathematics!

According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself). Example: The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2 and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
