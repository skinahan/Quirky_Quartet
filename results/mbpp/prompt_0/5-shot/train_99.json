The result should be a list containing only unique elements. However, the order of elements in the output should be same as in the input. If there are multiple occurrences of an element, it should appear only once in the output. For example, if the input is [1,2,3,2], then the output should be [1,2,3]. And if there are multiple occurrences of an element which is not adjacent to each other (e.g., [1, 2 ,3 , 2 , 4] ), then keep only one occurrence and remove other occurrences. So for this case the expected output will be [1 , 2 , 3 , 4]. You can assume that all elements in the list are hashable and comparable with each other. For example you can use lists or tuples but not dictionaries or sets for this problem. Also note that you cannot use any library functions like set() or sorted() or any such built-in functions to solve this question; you have to write your own code for removing duplicates from a list without using any library functions. You may however use len(), enumerate(), range() and other such built-in functions as needed without restrictions on their usage as long as they do not solve this question directly by themselves; your solution must be self contained with no external dependencies except these built-in functions mentioned above (and data structures like lists). Note that we want you to write your own code and not just call some existing library function like set(). Also note that we want you to return a new list instead of modifying an existing list passed into your function; so make sure that your solution does not modify its input argument(s). You can assume that all arguments passed into your function will always be valid arguments; so no error checking is necessary for invalid inputs provided by user/caller/tester etc.; however if there are invalid inputs then it is acceptable for your program to crash by throwing exceptions etc.; also it is acceptable if your program produces unexpected results instead of crashing when given invalid inputs (note though that producing unexpected results when given invalid inputs is highly undesirable behavior from user point of view).

The coins that we have are infinite supply of {1,2,5} denominations. Given a value V, if we want to make change for V Rs., and we have infinite supply of each of the denominations in Indian currency, i.e., we have infinite supply of { 1, 2, 5 } valued coins/notes/denominations. What is the minimum number of coins and/or notes needed to make the change? For example: If V = 100 then output should be 2 as we require one 5 Rs coin and two 1 Rs coin to make a total sum equal to 100. If V = 6 then output should be 3 as we require three 2 Rs coin to make a total sum equal to 6. If V = 11 then output should be 3 as we require three 2 Rs coin and one 5 Rs coin to make a total sum equal to 11. Note that you can use any denomination (coin or note) more than once if required. Also note that you can use any combination which gives you the minimum number of denominations (coins or notes). So it is not necessary that you need only two 1Rs notes or only two 5Rs notes but you can use any combination which gives the minimum number of denominations (coins or notes) required for making up given value using Indian currency system where there are infinite supply available for each denomination (coin or note). You just need to tell how many coins and/or notes are needed for making up given value using Indian currency system where there are infinite supply available for each denomination (coin or note). You also need not worry about order in which they appear in result list because it is not important here whether they appear first or last but what is important here is how many numbers from result list makes up given value because our aim here is just find out how many numbers from result list makes up given value so that those numbers could be used as denominations later on when actually making up given value using Indian currency system where there are infinite supply available for each denomination (coin or note). So just keep in mind that order doesn't matter here when counting how many numbers from result",
