If given number is prime number, then return True, otherwise False. The given input must be an integer greater than 1, otherwise raise ValueError exception with message \"Input must be greater than 1\". For example, if you call this function with input value 3, then it should return True; if you call this function with input value 10, then it should return False since 10 is not prime number since it can be divided by 2 without remainder or its square root is less than 4. For example, if you call this function with input value 0 or -1 or -10 or string 'hello', then it should raise ValueError exception with message \"Input must be greater than 1\". Hint: You may use math module for checking whether square root of given number is less than 4 as follows import math math.sqrt(16) # returns 4 since square root of 16 is 4 math.sqrt(15) # returns 3.872983346207417 since square root of 15 is 3.872983346207417 Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.
