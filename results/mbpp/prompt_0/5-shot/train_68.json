The function should take two arguments, one is the file name and another is a number that indicates how many top frequent words you need to print. The default value of this argument is 10. If you don't specify this argument, it should print 10 top frequent words by default. The output should be sorted by its frequency in descending order and in case of a tie, alphabetically increasing order of the word itself. Also note that punctuations(.,;) are part of words and need to be taken care of when counting the frequency of each word. Your function should ignore cases when counting words i.e \"The\" and \"the\" are considered same word for this question. You can use space as a delimiter for splitting strings into list of words for processing them further based on your choice of data structures/algorithms used to solve this question but make sure not to use any builtin split functions like str.split(), strtok() etc because using such builtin functions would make your solution trivial and wouldn't help you improve your coding skills(which is the main goal of this question). Also note that you can assume that input file contains english text only without any unicode characters/emojis etc which will keep things simple while processing it further based on your choice of data structures/algorithms used to solve this question but again make sure not to use any builtin functions or libraries like nltk etc which provide readymade solutions for such problems because using such builtin functions/libraries would make your solution trivial and wouldn't help you improve your coding skills(which is the main goal fo this question).

For example, if the given number is 813195 and the given digit is 5, then it should print 2 as 5 occurs twice in 813195. The input number and digit are taken as a string and an integer respectively. If the input number is not a valid integer or if the input digit length is more than 1, then print -1. If any of these two inputs are None or empty string, then print -2. If both inputs are None or empty string, then print -3. Note that in python 3 you can directly pass an integer value to your function instead of converting it into a string as done here for testing purposes. So you can change your code accordingly to remove this conversion step from your code when using python 3 for implementation of this question. Also note that 0 <= d <= 9 where d is the input digit and 0 <= n <= 10^10 where n is the input number (in string format). You may assume that there will be no leading zeros in either case i.e., when n = \"0123\" or d = 0 (zero). You can use any builtin functions available in python 3 like int(), float(), str(), etc., but not eval() which evaluates arbitrary expressions/strings as python statements which could be dangerous while evaluating user inputs (to prevent malicious attacks on your code). Also note that you need to implement this function without using any external modules like pandas, numpy, etc., but builtins like map(), reduce(), filter() etc., are allowed along with list comprehensions and generators which have been explained in class already but covered here again for completeness sake only!
