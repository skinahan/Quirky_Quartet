Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures.\r\n\n - Note that this is not a programming question, but more of an algorithm based question where you have to think how you will solve it using programming constructs like loops and conditional statements. \n\n - For example, if you are asked to find out whether a given number is prime or not, then your answer should look something like this: \n\n - def isPrime(n): \r - #your code here  return result  \n\n - Here n denotes an integer value passed from outside which needs to be checked whether its prime or not and result denotes a boolean value which needs to be returned by your function (True if its prime else False). You can write helper functions as well if required but it should be called from within isPrime(). You can also have other variables as well but they should be local variables defined inside isPrime(). Please note that we will only check your solution by passing different values of n into isPrime() and verifying whether its returning True or False as expected based on our solution (not by running your script directly). So please stick with this format while writing your answer. Also note that we would not pass any negative numbers into your solution so you don't need check for negative numbers explicitly in your solution (we will verify yours against ours). If there are multiple solutions possible, then just give one of them (its ok even if its not optimal). Don't worry about efficiency here since these questions are more about correctness than performance/efficiency. Please try giving answers without using any external libraries/packages as much as possible so that we can evaluate them easily (if you want some extra points then try writing code without using any external libraries/packages!).

The function should return -1 if it is impossible to make change using the given coin denominations. The number of coins should be as small as possible. The order of coins doesn't matter. You can use multiple instances of same type of coin to make up the total amount needed. For example, if you have 3 denominations and you need 5 units, then it is possible by using 2 instances of denomination 2 and 1 instance of denomination 1 since 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. But this solution is not optimal because there exists another solution which uses only one instance each for all 3 denominations and hence requires only 3 coins in total (instead of 4). So, your function should return 3 when passed (5, [1,2,3]). Also note that your function shouldn't take any extra input other than the array holding coin denominations and the amount for which change needs to be made. So you don't have to worry about things like number of types or values present in array denom[]. There will always be at least one type/value present in denom[]. Also note that there are no negative values allowed in denom[] array or n value (amount). If n < 0 or any value present in denom[] is < 0 then your code should return -1 without doing anything else as it means that it is not possible to make change with given set of values/types/denominations. For example if n = 5 and denom[] = [-3] then your code should simply return -1 without doing anything else because there does not exist any valid set which can produce 5 units with just one type (-3) having infinite supply available with us but with negative value so we can't use any instance(s) from this type(-3) even once because its value is negative so we can't add it anywhere while trying to get sum=5 by adding instances from different types/values available in denom[]. Your code must also handle cases where n == 0 or n == some positive integer but denom[] has no elements i.e., len(denom) == 0 . In these cases also you should simply return",
