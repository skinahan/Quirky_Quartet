Note that this is not an interview question, but it will help you understand how you can use your own logic to solve problems which might look difficult at first sight. You can also use this approach for similar problems like checking if a number is even or odd, checking whether it is divisible by 9 or not etc., but make sure that you try these problems on your own first before looking at their solutions here! There are multiple solutions for this problem, one of them will be discussed in our next post! You can try solving all these problems on your own now before reading further! If you have any doubts regarding any of these problems or their solutions, please feel free to ask them in our discussion forum! We will be happy to answer them! If you have any suggestions regarding other interesting programming questions which we could include here, do let us know through our discussion forum as well! And finally, thank you all for reading this article so far! We hope that some of these questions helped you learn something new today and we would love to see some more such articles from us in future too!
