If multiple elements have the same highest frequency, then return the element that appears first in the tuple. For example, given (5, 2, 7, 5, 4, 7), your function should return 5. If there is no most common element (i.e., all elements have equal frequency), then your function should return None. You can assume that there will be at least one element in the tuple. If you are using Python 2 or Python 3 with an older version of collections than what we used to test this problem (Python 3.6 or later), then you can use Counter instead of collections.Counter to solve this problem (but it will not earn you extra credit). You can use any built-in functions and do not need to import any external libraries for this problem other than collections if you are using Python 3 with an older version of collections than what we used to test this problem (Python 3.6 or later). Do not use any other external libraries for this problem unless explicitly permitted by your instructor; doing so will result in a score of 0 for this question regardless of whether your solution works because it makes testing much more difficult for us and thus increases our grading time which takes away from time that we could be spending helping students learn material better through office hours and answering questions on Piazza which benefits everyone in the class more than just those who ask/answer questions on Piazza because everyone gets access to all questions/answers on Piazza. Your code must run in linear time; otherwise it will timeout during grading and you will receive a score of 0 for this question regardless of whether your solution works because it makes testing much more difficult for us and thus increases our grading time which takes away from time that we could be spending helping students learn material better through office hours and answering questions on Piazza which benefits everyone in the class more than just those who ask/answer questions on Piazza because everyone gets access to all questions/answers on Piazza even though we would prefer to give partial credit when possible instead of giving 0 points when possible as long as your code runs in linear time since O(n) solutions generally tend to",
