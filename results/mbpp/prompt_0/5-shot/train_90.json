If there are more than one such substrings, print the first occurring substring. If no such substring exists, print -1. For example, if the input strings are \"abcdxyz\" and \"xyzabcd\", then longest common substring is \"abcd\" and its length is 4. If the input strings are \"zxabcdezy\" and \"yzabcdezx\", then the output should be -1 as there is no common substring between these two strings. The output string should be lowercase only. For example, if the input string is \u201cABCDEF\u201d then output should be \u201cabcdef\u201d only. You can use built-in functions to solve this problem but you can also write your own logic without using built-in functions to solve this problem. Note that you can import any module but it should be a standard module which comes with python installation on any machine (for eg: sys). You cannot use any external modules which needs to be installed separately (for eg: numpy). Also note that your code will run on our servers so do not hardcode anything but generate outputs based on inputs only (for eg: It is okay to hardcode a list index or loop counter but not an entire list or dictionary). Also note that inputs can contain special characters so take care of Unicode while comparing and printing output as well (for eg: In case of input being \u201ca\u20acbc\u201d and \u201ca\u20acbd\u201d, both have same characters except for one character whose Unicode value might be different). You may assume that all inputs will have valid values when passed into your function definition and/or called from main(). You may also assume that each test case will have at least one common substring between two given strings otherwise output will always be -1 for such test cases.
