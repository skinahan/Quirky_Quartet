The first two terms of the series are given as input. The function should return the nth term of the series as output. Note that if n=1, then it should return first term, if n=2, then it should return second term and so on. You can assume that n will always be a positive integer and greater than zero. Also note that 0 is not a valid value for any variable in this question unless mentioned otherwise. You can also assume that both firstTerm and commonRatio will always be integers greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to 100 respectively. If any of these conditions are violated then your function should raise an error with an appropriate error message as shown in sample test cases below. If all conditions are satisfied, then you can go ahead and find out the answer for the given values of firstTerm, commonRatio and n by following geometric progression formula mentioned above in description section (you can also refer to sample test case 2). Return your answer after rounding off to two decimal places (you can refer to sample test case 3). You may use python's inbuilt round() function for this purpose (please refer here if you would like more information on how round() works). Please note that we have enabled python3 compiler for this question so you could use python3 specific features if needed but please ensure that your code runs correctly when compiled with python2 compiler as well because some users might use python2 compiler instead of python3 compiler when attempting this question on our platform but we'll still run their code using python3 interpreter only i.e., we'll run their code using our default compiler which is currently set to python3 . We'll not change our default compiler from now onwards until there is a good reason for doing so but please keep these things in mind while writing your solution because users who would attempt this question on our platform might be using different compilers depending upon their choice/preference but we'll always run their submitted code using only one single compiler which is our default one i.e., currently set to Python 3 . So please try not to use any feature/functionality specific only to Python 3 unless there's no other alternative because Python 2 doesn't support those features/functionalities",
