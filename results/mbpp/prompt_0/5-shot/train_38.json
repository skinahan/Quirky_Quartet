The input list is sorted in non-decreasing order.  The output must also be sorted in non-decreasing order.  Any solution that does not sort the output will receive no credit.   You may assume that the input contains only positive integers, each of which is less than or equal to 10,000.   If there are multiple solutions with the same number of operations, use the lexicographically smallest one.   For example, if there are two solutions with 3 operations and they differ only in whether you add or subtract 1 from some number, use the one that adds 1 (i.e., performs an increment operation) before subtracting 1 (i.e., performing a decrement operation).  You may assume that your solution runs in time O(n) where n is the length of lst and uses O(1) additional space beyond what is required for lst itself (you do not have to prove this).   Hint: think about how you can use two pointers simultaneously to scan through lst from left to right while maintaining the desired invariant .   Do not make any assumptions about whether repeated elements appear consecutively or not; your code should work correctly even when they do not appear consecutively . You may assume that all elements of lst are distinct . For example, if n=10 then your code might begin by setting left = 0 and right = 9 and then performing some sequence of increment/decrement operations on one or both pointers until left > right; at this point you would know that every element between indices 0 and 9 inclusive had been examined precisely once and so could return those elements as your answer without further ado . However , it's possible that you might need to perform more than 10 such operations before left > right becomes true; for example , it's possible that after setting left = 0 and right = 9 you might perform some sequence of increment/decrement operations on one or both pointers until eventually left = 5 and right = 4 ; at this point it would be incorrect for your code simply to return [lst[5],lst[4]] as its answer because although those two elements have been examined precisely",
