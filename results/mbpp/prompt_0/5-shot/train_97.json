Note: You can find the GCD using math module and use it as a function in your code. Also, use floor division operator // while calculating quotient and modulo operator % while calculating remainder during division operation between two integers. For example, 7/2 will give 3 as quotient and 1 as remainder when using floor division operator // which ignores the decimal values if any (for example 3.5).
