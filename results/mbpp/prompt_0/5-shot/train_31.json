You need to buy shares before selling it. Also you need to sell the share before buying another one. Here is the list of share prices per day: [310,315,275,295,260,270,290,230,255,250]. The output should be 18 as indicated by red arrows in above diagram. The points marked with blue are invalid transactions as they break the rule of buying before selling and vice versa. Hence they are not considered while calculating maximum profit. For example: if we buy at 260 and sell at 290 then we cannot buy again at 275 since that breaks the rule of buying before selling and vice versa.. This problem is also called as Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock problem.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.
