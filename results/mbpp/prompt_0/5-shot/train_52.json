The list is given as input to the function. Use all() method to check if all elements are equal in a list. If all elements are equal then return true else false. Use any() method to check if any element is true in a list. If any element is true, then return true else false. Use enumerate() method to get (index, value) tuple from an iterable object and use zip() method to get an iterator that aggregates elements from each of the iterables passed as arguments into tuples and use set() method to convert an iterable object into distinct element list and finally use sorted() method to sort distinct element list in ascending order. Return the sorted distinct element list as output of the function. The expected output for given input [[1,2,3],[4,5],[6],[7]] is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] . Note: Do not import any other module other than itertools . Also do not use any other functions or methods other than those mentioned above except len(). Also do not convert the given input or output lists into numpy arrays or pandas dataframes or similar data structures in your solution code. Just solve this problem using only standard python libraries without using numpy , pandas etc., as they will be introduced only later when you learn about them during your machine learning course later after this test is over and you will be evaluated on how well you can solve problems without using these libraries too which are used extensively by industry professionals but not many people know how these libraries work internally since they are very complex so we would like our candidates also be able to solve problems without using these libraries too since they will be introduced only later after this test is over so please don't worry if you don't know them yet since we won't be evaluating you on that at this time but just on how well you can solve problems with standard python libraries only which are sufficient for solving most real world problems anyway so please don't worry about that either and just focus on doing your best here",

The data set D is given as a list of strings. The output should be a list of strings. Ignore case while comparing words i.e., \"Hello\" and \"hello\" are considered same word. Assume that k is always less than or equal to the number of distinct elements in D (you don\u2019t need to check this). If there are ties then you can print any one of them in any order. You can use built-in heap queue method and also write your own code for implementing heaps using list or arrays as you like. You can assume that all the strings will be lower case only and there will be no punctuations or other special characters except space character ' '. You may use defaultdict type from collections module if required but it is not mandatory. Please create your own test cases to test your solution before submission for grading. Also note that we have provided some test cases which may or may not be sufficient to check your solution completely so you have to come up with some additional test cases on your own before submitting this assignment for grading if you think that our given test cases are not sufficient enough to test your solution properly and completely (though they will give you some idea about how much score you are going to get after submission). We recommend that instead of hard coding the expected output in assertion statements please use assertAlmostEqual() function instead so that it becomes easier for us at our end to grade your assignment without facing any difficulties due to rounding off errors etc., which may happen due to hard-coding expected output into assertion statement itself (we don't want such kind of issues at our end while grading). But still if you want then you can use simple assert statements with expected output hard-coded inside them but make sure that the expected outputs are correct because otherwise it will result into getting zero marks for this question even though everything else is correct in your code just because the expected outputs were wrong (so please take care about this issue while writing assertions).

A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward or forward. The function should ignore case and punctuation. For example if the input is \"Madam\" it should return True as it's a palindrome ignoring case and punctuation. Do not use any built in functions like reverse() etc for this question. You can use list slicing for this question. For example: String[::-1] returns the string in reverse order (Note: You are not allowed to use this). You can also convert string to list using list(String) method and then perform operations on the list data structure like pop(), append() etc to solve this question without using any builtin functions like reverse(). Also try solving this question without using any loops (hint: Use recursion). Also try solving it with loops (hint: Use while loop). Note that you need to solve only one of these three approaches and submit your answer for that approach only. Don't implement all three approaches! Also note that your code should be generic enough so that you can pass any string as an argument to your function and it should work correctly irrespective of what kind of string is passed i.e., your code shouldn't assume anything about the type/length of input passed as an argument but simply check whether it's a palindrome or not based on some logic which you will write inside your function! Don't print anything inside your function! Just return True/False depending on whether the input string is palindrome or not! Write additional comments/docstrings wherever necessary! Your code should be generic enough so that it shouldn't throw exceptions due to unexpected inputs! If such cases occur, just return False from your code without throwing exceptions! Also handle all edge cases like empty strings, strings having length 1 etc gracefully in your code instead of throwing exceptions! In other words, make sure that you are handling all kinds of inputs gracefully instead of simply assuming what type/length of input will be passed by user at runtime when he/she invokes our function i.e., don't make assumptions about",

Return 0 if there are no such substrings. Consider that all lowercase letters have the same weight and that the length of the string is less than or equal to 5000. For example, \"abcbbbbcccbdddadacb\" has the longest substring with k = 2 unique characters: \"bcbbbbcccb\". The answer must be unique, in other words there can be maximum one substring with longest length for each value of k. In case of more than one solution you may print any one of them. If there is no such substring return 0 as mentioned above. You may assume that there will be only lower case letters in the given string and your code should be efficient enough to not time out for larger values of n and k (n <= 5000, 1 <= k <= 26). Also note that input strings may contain whitespace characters which should be ignored while solving this question. For example, \"abcd efghi jklmn opqrst uvwxyz\" has longest substring with 2 unique characters as \"efghi jklmn\". Note that input strings may contain whitespace which should also be considered while extracting substrings (See below examples). Please refer to sample test cases for more clarity on expected output format.
