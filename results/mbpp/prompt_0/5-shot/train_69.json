The list contains duplicate numbers and has both positive and negative numbers. The consecutive numbers can be in any order. For example, [3, 2, 1, 4] has a longest consecutive elements sequence of length 3 (order is 3, 2, 1), [9, -2, -3, 11] has length 4 (order is 9,-2,-3 and 11) and [0,-2] has length 1. Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity. If two sequences are of equal length then return the sequence starting with the number whose absolute value is less. For example [-39,-36,-40], output should be [-36]. If there are multiple sequences with same length then pick any one of them. For example [-5,-1,-7], output can be either [-5] or [-7]. Assume that there will be only one longest consecutive elements sequence in each input list. Also note that you need to return the actual longest consecutive element sequence instead of just its size/length. So for input [9, -2, -3 , 11], output should be [9,-2,-3]. Similarly for input [0], output should be [0]. If input array is empty then return an empty list as well as if all elements are non-consecutive then also return an empty list . Do not use any built-in functions like sort() or sorted(). You may use only constant extra space plus modify the original array/list in-place for storage purpose only but make sure your function runs in linear time O(n). Do not modify any other data structure like lists etc directly (without using it as a parameter). You may assume that all inputs are valid like non-empty arrays containing unique numbers only except mentioned above cases where all elements are non-consecutive or array being empty etc . Also you may assume that all inputs contain integers only (not floats or other data types). So no need to do type checking etc before processing further . And lastly you may assume that input array/",
