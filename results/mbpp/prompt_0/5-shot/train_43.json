The function should also print the largest and smallest numbers in the given list. If there are multiple largest and smallest numbers, then print them all with a space in between. In case of duplicates, remove them from the list. Use only built-in functions to find these values. Return 0 if input is None or empty list or any other data type other than list. In case of error, return -1. Note: Ignore case sensitivity while finding min and max values for strings i.e., consider 'A' and 'a' as same value for strings. Do not use any in-built functions to perform sorting or reversing etc., Also note that you can't use sort() method twice on the same list as it would modify the original list itself which may lead to unwanted results/errors in your code during evaluation by our test cases (which may be hidden). Also do not use any lambda functions while solving this question as they are not allowed for this question set during evaluation by our test cases (which may be hidden). For example: If input_list is [10, 5, -4, 6], then your function should return 9 as output after printing \"-4 10\" which represents min and max values respectively from input_list without duplicates or sorting it explicitly using any sort() method provided by Python language itself or using lambda functions etc., Do not modify contents of input_list argument passed into this function before returning from it as it would lead to unwanted results/errors during evaluation by our test cases (which may be hidden).
