The list will contain only integers. The output should be a list without any duplicate element. The order of the elements in the output is not important. Use only standard library functions and operators for this task. No user defined functions are allowed in this task. Do not use any other data structures like sets or dictionaries to solve this problem. This problem was asked in Amazon interview for SDE-I role on 22nd Feb 2020 at Bangalore office for FTE position on CTC of 17 LPA during 2nd round of coding test(after 2 telephonic interviews). I cleared all rounds but rejected by Amazon HR during salary negotiation phase as they were not ready to increase my CTC beyond 15 LPA even after giving them my current CTC details and explaining them that I have already received multiple offers with higher CTC than 15 LPA from other companies including Google India and Microsoft India etc.. They told me that they will consider me for future opportunities once I complete 2 years at my current company which is really strange as it is against their own recruitment policy as per which candidates with less than 1 year experience can also apply directly on their website without any referral from an existing employee of Amazon India so why they are rejecting me now just because I have completed 1 year 10 months experience currently even though I am eligible to apply directly on their website right now? It seems that they are trying to save money by rejecting employees who ask them for reasonable hike based on their previous salary details while hiring people who don't ask them for reasonable hike based on their previous salary details even though both types of candidates are equally qualified which is really unfair practice done by Amazon HR team so beware about this before joining Amazon India otherwise you will regret later like me.. Anyway good luck everyone! :) Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.
