The first prime number is 2. The second prime number is 3 and so on. For example, the 10th prime number is 29. The 11th prime number is 31 and so on. Use dynamic programming to solve this question. Do not use any pre-defined functions/libraries (other than dynamic arrays). You can write additional functions to solve this problem. The header of the function is given below: def nthPrime(n): #write your code here Input Format: There will be only one line of input, which contains an integer N Output Format: Print an integer which denotes the Nth Prime Number Example Input/Output 1: Input: 7 Output : 17 Example Input/Output 2: Input: 19 Output : 71 Hints & Tips Hint 1 Think about how you can use memoization to store solutions of sub-problems and reuse them when needed later? Answer 1 def nthPrime(n): arr = [0 for i in range(n)] arr[0] = 2 for i in range(1, n): for j in range(arr[i - 1] + 1, 100000): flag = 0 for k in range(i): if j % arr[k] == 0 : flag = 1 break if flag == 0 : arr[i] = j break print (arr[n - 1]) return () Hint 2 How do you check whether a given number is a prime or not? Answer 2 def nthPrime(n): arr = [0 for i in range(n)] arr[0] = 2 cntr=2 while cntr<=100000 : flag=0 for k in range (cntr-1) : if cntr%arr[k]==0 : flag=1 break if flag==0 : arr.append (cntr) cntr+=1 print (arr) return () Hint 3 What does memoization mean? It means that instead of computing the answer to a problem from scratch every time it needs solving, we can save some time by remembering what we computed previously and using that instead whenever possible",
