Palindrome are the strings which read same from backward as well as forward. For example, \"madam\" is a palindrome string whereas apple is not a palindrome string. The question does not contain any input and output arguments, you need to complete the function and return true or false accordingly. Note: Ignore whitespaces while checking for palindromes. For example, \"ab ba\" is considered as a palindrome string even though there are spaces in between them. Also ignore capitalization of characters while checking for palindromes i.e., consider both uppercase and lowercase characters as same. For example, \"AaBbCcDd\" is also considered as a palindrome string because it reads same from backward after ignoring its capitalization of characters. Also consider empty strings \"\" (with quotes) as valid input and return true from your function if you encounter an empty string else return false if you encounter an empty string. You can assume that all inputs will be non-empty strings only and will contain at least one character (i.e., either lowercase or uppercase). You don't need to print anything explicitly; it has already been taken care by driver code below your function definition which internally calls your function with various test cases to check if it's working fine or not! Sample Test Cases: Sample Input 1: madam Sample Output 1: True Explanation 1: Since 'madam' reads same from backward after ignoring its capitalization of characters, it's considered as a palindrome string so we have returned True from our code . Sample Input 2: Abba Sample Output 2: True Explanation 2: Since 'Abba' reads same from backward after ignoring its capitalization of characters, it's considered as a palindrome string so we have returned True from our code . Sample Input 3: AbBa Sample Output 3 : False Explanation 3 : Since 'AbBa' doesn't read same from backward after ignoring its capitalization of characters, it",
