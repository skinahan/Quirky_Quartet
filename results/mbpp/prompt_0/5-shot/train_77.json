The root node will not have any parent nodes. You can use the following class to create tree objects:\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. The classes Node and Tree are already defined for you in the editor below, so all you need to do is complete these functions in order to get started with your program! Note that we've included a helper function get_levelorder() which takes in an instance of Tree as input and returns an array containing all values present in the given tree using level-order traversal (i.e., first left-to-right across levels, then top-down across levels). This may help you test your code as you work on it! You'll also notice that we've included some boilerplate code which reads input from stdin, builds one Tree object per line of input, calls your function for each Tree object, and prints output to stdout as desired by problem statement - your task is to fill in the missing lines so that correct values are printed out!

The function should return the index of the first non-repeating character in the string. If no such character is found, it should return -1.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nThink along the lines of the variables and data structures that need to be used. Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures. Example: if input_string = \"abcdabce\", then your function should return 3 as index 3 is of character 'd' which is first non-repeating character in input_string. If input_string = \"abcbad\", then your function should return -1 as there are no non-repeating characters in input_string. If input_string = \"aabbccddee\", then your function should return -1 as there are no non-repeating characters in input_string. Note that capitalization does not matter here i.e., an upper case character is considered same as lower case character hence 'A' and 'a' are considered same here (and so are 'B', 'b', ...). You can assume that there will be only alphabetic characters (i.e., a to z or A to Z) in any given string, you don't have to worry about numbers, special symbols etc for this problem statement (although you may consider these when solving other questions). Also note that an empty string \"\" is considered valid i/p with no non-repeating characters hence your output for this case should be 0 (as empty string has one single character which happens not to repeat itself). You can also assume that all inputs will be valid strings i/e., you don't need to check for None inputs etc for this problem statement (although you may consider these when solving other questions). For more clarity on what exactly constitutes a valid string please see test cases provided below under sample test cases section or look at template code provided below under solution section where examples have been explained clearly with comments wherever necessary or contact us on support@interviewbitacademy if you have any further doubts regarding this question statement or its expected output format etc..
