The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence that is present in given two sequences in the same order. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, \u201cabc\u201d, \u201cabg\u201d, \u201cbdf\u201d, \u201caeg\u201d, \u2018\u201dacefg\u201d,... etc are subsequences of \u201cabcdefg\". So a string of length n has 2^n different possible subsequences. It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of diff (a file comparison program that outputs the differences between two files), and has applications in bioinformatics. Note: Two strings need to be passed as parameters and their lengths should be greater than or equal to 1 and both strings can have different lengths. Also note that you need to find the length of LCS for given two strings and return it as an output parameter from this function call. If there are more than one LCS present then print any one of them or print \"No such string found\". If there are no common characters between two strings then return 0 as output parameter from this function call. You can implement your own logic here and change the arguments if required but function name should be \"longestCommonSubsequence\" only without quotes otherwise solution will not be accepted by our checker tool while grading your code! Also you can use dynamic programming approach to solve this question efficiently! Note: This question will only have one test case with fixed inputs so please do not expect any input test cases at runtime! Also note that we will check all corner cases for each input values before grading your code so don't worry about edge cases! Task: Write a python function to solve the above question which takes three parameters str1 (string 1), str2 (string 2) and n (length of LCS). No additional comments and docstrings are needed here except main() method which we have already provided below after pre-defined template which you need to fill up with your solution logic!

O(k) vs O(1) time complexity!  (k is len of seq)   <-- The extra copy is why we use extend() instead of append() when adding multiple items to list!   append() does one item at a time so no copying needed!   Also you can use `list += other_list` syntax for extend() too, which is faster than using `list = list + other_list` syntax because it doesn't make an extra copy first like `+` does... it just mutates original list object directly by extending it with other_list's items!!! (works with any iterable object like sets or tuples too!)  Just don't do that with strings though, because strings are immutable so you'd be creating new string objects each time instead of mutating original string object... instead use += syntax on strings which also doesn't make an extra copy first like + does, it just concatenates them together and returns new string object which has reference stored in variable name!!!     https://waymoot.org/home/python_string/ )      https://waymoot.org/home/python_string/)       https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17330160/how-does-the-extend-method-work )       https://stackoverflow.com/questions/252703/append-vs",

The order of characters should not be considered for palindrome check. For e.g., \"aba\" is a palindrome, but \"abb\" is not a palindrome. The output should be case sensitive and the characters which are not alphabets should be ignored while checking for palindromes. For e.g., \"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama.\" is an input string where the output should be 15 (7 palindromic substrings - amanaplanacanalpanama, anaplanacanalpanam, anacabanacana). Also consider single character strings as valid palindrome strings and ignore spaces while counting the number of substrings as valid palindromes (For e.g., consider \"a\", \"\" as valid strings and do not ignore spaces like \" \", \"-\", etc.). Also note that removing spaces will change the indices of other characters and hence the output may vary depending on whether you consider spaces or remove them while calculating the number of substrings that are palindromes in a given string (For e.g., A man, a plan,a canal-Panama! has 15 non-space characters and 18 total characters including spaces so there are 18C2 = 153 substring combinations possible out of which 15 are palindromic if we include space in our consideration or 12C2 = 66 substring combinations possible out of which 9 are pallidromic if we remove spaces).\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.
