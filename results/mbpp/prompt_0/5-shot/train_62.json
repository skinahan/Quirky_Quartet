The given board is represented as a list of lists. Each list represents a row in the board. If a number is zero then that position cannot be filled with any dominoes and if a number is one then that position can be filled with any dominoes. The first element in the list represents the first row and so on. For example [[1,0],[1,0],[1,0]] represents 3x2 board where first two positions are not fillable and last two positions are fillable. You have to return an integer value representing the total number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board. If no possible way to fill exists then return zero. Note that you have to return only integer value not any data structure like array or list etc.. The output must be less than 10^9 + 7 because this value can exceed for large input values. For more details watch question video and also read sample test cases carefully before submission because there are many test cases which will help you understand problem better. Watch question video here https://youtu.be/8WpYiGjVtD4 . You don't need to write comments or doc strings in your code just write your solution code as it is easy to understand without comments or doc strings but make sure your code is readable and understandable by others who want to read your code later on.. Also no need of main function just write your solution function only as it's mentioned in question description so other programmers who want to read your code later on will not get confused because they won't see main function anywhere when they try reading your code.. So just write one solution function only and submit it.. Happy Coding! Cheers!!

You are allowed to remove only one element at a time. You have to find the number of ways in which you can remove elements from the array. The order of removing does not matter. For example, if N = 4 and Arr[ ] = {2, 3, 4, 5}, then we can remove 2 in three different ways {2, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 5} and {3, 4 ,5}. We can also remove 3 in two different ways {2 ,4 ,5} and {2 ,3 ,4}. So total number of ways is five. As another example if N = 3 and Arr[ ] = {4 ,5 ,6}, then we can remove 4 in two different ways : {5 6} and {4 6}. We cannot remove 5 or 6 as GCD becomes 1 only when there is a single element left in array (GCD of single element is always one). So total number of ways is two. If no element can be removed return -1. Note that it is possible that the answer may not fit even in 64 bit signed integer range so take answer modulo 10^9+7 before returning it. See examples for more clarity on this point:\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.
