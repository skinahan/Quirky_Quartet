If the number of elements is even, the middle two elements are to be added first and then the sum is to be computed. If the number of elements is odd, the middle element is to be added first and then compute sum. The same process has to repeated for left and right halves of mid element (if there are any). For example, for an input list - [4,5,5,4], output should be 22 (4+4+5+5+4). Please note that this question has been asked in our previous assessment as well. It has been included again as it involves recursion which we feel is important for you to practice before your interview with us.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Note that you can use len() function which gives length of a list or string passed as argument. Also note that float values need not be rounded off while computing answer. You can just compare your answer with our provided output using == operator after converting both values into ints or floats respectively (as applicable). You may consider 0 as input value for empty list [] in your code but this value will never appear in our test cases unless explicitly mentioned otherwise in problem statement itself..

If no prefix is found, return empty string. Return the prefix in lower case. Ignore all the special characters in strings (e.g., \"!\" or \"#\" or \"$\"). Assume that there will be only one longest common prefix and it will be unique for each set of input strings. If there are ties, return all possible answers in alphabetically sorted order (e.g., if given inputs are [\"flower\",\"flow\",\"flight\"] then output should be \"fl\"). Ignore case sensitivity while comparing strings (i.e., treat upper and lower cases as same). If given list is empty, return an empty string as output (\"\"). Assume that all the characters in all the strings are from English alphabets (i.e., [a-zA-Z]). You don't need to validate inputs or raise exceptions, etc., for this problem statement; you can assume that inputs provided to your function will always be valid and correct according to above mentioned rules/guidelines/specifications/assumptions about inputs/etc.; you can focus on writing a correct solution instead of handling corner cases, etc.; you may use built-in functions/methods from Python's standard library; you may write additional helper methods if required but do not change method signature of given function prototype; do not use any third party libraries; do not modify contents of lists passed as arguments to your function; do not create any new lists or data structures except local variables inside your method body; avoid using global variables inside your method body; avoid using other programming constructs like maps, dictionaries, sets, arrays, lists, etc.; avoid mutating/modifying contents of lists passed as arguments to your method body (do not change values at indices already present in list but it's fine if you append new values at end or insert new values at indices not already present); avoid hardcoding any test cases inside your code itself because we will evaluate your code by passing different test cases during grading so hardcoded test cases won't help anyway because they won't match with our test cases during grading and hence such solutions will fail during evaluation and consequently lose points even",
