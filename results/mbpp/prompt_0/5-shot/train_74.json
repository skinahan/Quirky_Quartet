The order of numbers in the input should not matter. You can assume that the list of numbers will not contain any duplicates. Don't worry about time complexity for this question. You can also assume that K will always be positive. For example: input_list = [1, 7, 5, 9, 2, 12] and k = 2 then your function should return 3 as there are three pairs with a difference of 2 i.e (1, 3), (3, 5) and (7, 9). I have provided you some test cases to get started on this question. You can use these test cases to check your code but you don't need to submit them along with your code submission on EdX platform. The test cases are given below: Test case 1: ([1], 0) Expected output : 0 Test case 2 : ([2], 1) Expected output : 1 Test case 3 : ([0], 0) Expected output : 0 Test case 4 : ([1], 1) Expected output : 1 Test case 5 : ([2,-2], 4) Expected output : 0 Test case 6 : ([-3,-9,-8,-6,-5,-4,-10], -5) Expected output: 7 Task Write a python function to solve the above question.

If no such pair exists then it should return None. The list is unsorted. The function should accept three arguments as input, first is a list, second is an integer and third is an integer. The first argument represents the elements of the list and second and third arguments represent a number which needs to be found in the list. Function should return None if no such pair exists else it should return a tuple containing two numbers whose sum equals to given number. If there are multiple pairs then it can return any one of them. Note that order of numbers in tuple does not matter i.e., both (3, 5) and (5, 3) are acceptable answers for given example test cases but not ((3, 5), (5, 3)). Also note that input arguments cannot be modified by your code i.e., you don't have permission to modify contents of the lists passed as argument or values assigned to n1 or n2 variables respectively in test cases provided by us for testing your code submission on our platform i.e., you need to write your logic without modifying input arguments passed by us as shown in sample test case below:   For example:- Input List = [4, 7 , 1 , -3 , 2] N1 = 1 N2 = 2 Output = (-3 ,2 ) Input List = [4 ,7 ,1,-3 ,2] N1 = 15 N2 = 9 Output : None .   Note:- You can assume that all elements in input lists will be integers only .  You can also assume that all inputs will always be valid i.e., non-empty lists and non-zero n1 and n2 values will always be provided as inputs . Hint:- You can use dictionary data structure for this problem .  Answer : def find_sum(input_list,n1,n2): dict={} output=() for elem in input_list: dict[elem]=0 for elem in input_list: dict[elem]=dict[elem]+1 if((n1-elem)in dict): output=(min(n",
