Return the length of the longest substring. If there are multiple such substrings, return any one of them. If there is no such substring, return 0. The input string consists of only lowercase English letters [a-z] and its length is less than 10^5. It may contain duplicates characters within a substring but the count of distinct characters between two same characters should be more than or equal to k (i.e., [aaaa] can be considered as having only one distinct character with repeated occurrence 4 times). Example 1: Input : String=\"araaci\", k=2 Output: 4 Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is \"araa\". Example 2: Input : String=\"cbbebi\", k=3 Output: 5 Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are \"cbbeb\" & \"bbebi\". Note that both these substrings have their distinct character count equal to '3', but '5' is the largest possible length among both of these substrings.

The numbers should be unique. (The order of the elements in the output list is not important) . The function should return an empty list if there are no common numbers. Assume that the input lists do not have any duplicates. Hint: Use set() and '&' operator to find common elements in two lists. You can also use intersection() method to find common elements between two sets, but it will return a set object which is not accepted by the grader. If you want to use intersection() method then convert the returned set into a list using list(). The function should work with Python 2 as well as Python 3 both. Use appropriate data type for storing elements of input and output lists as per your Python version and remove/change any extra data type conversion code if already present in template code for this task.(Eg: In python2, you can directly pass string or integer values instead of converting them into float values before passing.)\nTask: Write a python function to solve the above question.

If not found, return -1. It should accept the given string and character as input arguments. For example, when you pass \"Python\" and \"P\" as input arguments to this function, it returns 1. When you pass \"Python\" and \"X\" as input arguments to this function, it returns -1. Note that we are looking for the second occurrence of a character in a string here not the first occurrence. Also note that Python is case sensitive here so we need to consider both upper case and lower case characters while searching for a character in a string. Also note that this question is different from finding all occurrences of a given character in a string because we need to find only one occurrence here which is at second position from left side of the given string (i.e., index 1). Please do not use any built-in functions or methods for solving this problem; implement your own logic using basic control flow statements like if-else and loops etc., only if necessary though. Do not use regular expressions too; they are beyond our scope here but they can be used effectively by knowing them well though! Feel free to use any other data structures like list or dictionary etc., but make sure that you solve this problem using basic control flow statements only! You may also write additional helper functions if required but again make sure that you don't use any built-in functions or methods there too! You may also write additional test cases if required but keep them simple please! We will be testing your code with our own set of test cases later so please do follow these guidelines carefully!
