It is guaranteed that the two strings have at least one common subsequence. Return the length of such longest common subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from one sequence by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining elements. Characters can only be deleted from either end of the string, and it is not allowed to delete all characters in one string. If there are multiple LCS with same length, return any one of them will do. You may assume that there is only lower case letters in both given strings, and if there are duplicate characters in each string, they should be counted as separate characters when comparing them with each other (i.e., 'a' == 'a', but 'A' != 'a'). The implementation should run in O(n^2) time complexity and O(n^2) space complexity where n denotes the length of s1 or s2 (whichever is longer).  For example, given s1 = \"abcde\" and s2 = \"ace\", your function should return 3 because \"abc\" and \"ace\" are LCSs; while given s1 = \"abc\" and s2 = \"def\", your function should return 0 because there's no LCS between these two strings. Hint: Dynamic Programming approach may help you solve this problem faster than brute force method which tries all possible combinations of substrings within both strings!
