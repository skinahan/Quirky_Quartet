For example 3 4 5 can form triangle but 3 4 8 cannot since 8 is greater than 3 + 4 combined length of sides..

Also write the pytest test cases to test the program. The program should be generic and should be able to run for any integer value of n. The function name should be odd_sum(). If the input to this function is not a positive integer then the function should return -1. Also write another program with pytest test cases to test whether or not a given number is an Armstrong number within a given range [lower, upper]. The program should take lower and upper as command line arguments and print all Armstrong numbers between lower and upper (including both) in comma separated form. The name of file containing program must be armstrong_number.py and classname must be ArmstrongNumberTestCase. If no armstrong numbers are found between lower and upper then print \u201c-1\u201d (without quotes). Note that an Armstrong number is such a number which is equal to sum of its digits raised to power total count of digits in it e.g 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 where 153 is an Armstrong number because 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 where 1, 5, 3 are its digits whose count is also 3 so that each digit raised to power count gives us back our original number 153 which makes it an Armstrong Number. Hint: Use list comprehension, lambda functions etc.. You can use any built-in python functions without importing any module/library but you can\u2019t use any user defined functions/methods except lambda functions or list comprehensions etc.. For example if you want square root of x then you can just use x**0.5 instead of using math module sqrt() method because we have restricted usage of user defined functions/methods except lambda functions or list comprehensions etc.. To get idea about how command line arguments work see sample run section below: Suppose your current working directory contains only files mentioned above i.e armstrong_number.py & test_armstrong_number.py then running command python -m pytest will search for all files starting with word \"test\" so it will pick up our file test_armstrong_number and run",
