Consider that all coins have same value. The function should accept two arguments - the input value for which we want to find the minimum number of coins and the list of coin values. Assume that the list of coin values is sorted in ascending order and is infinite (Having an unlimited supply of each coin value). The function should return an integer which denotes the minimum number of coins required to make up that value. If it is not possible to make that value with given set of coins then it should return -1. For example, if input value is 32 and list of coin values is {25, 10, 5} then output should be 2 as we can get 32 by using 25 two times. If input value is 33 and list of coin values is {25, 10, 5} then output should be -1 as it's not possible to get 33 using any combination from given set of coins.

The list contains numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive. The result should be [(2,8), (2,6), (2,4), (2,2), (4,8), (4,6), (4,4)...] The numbers 2 and 4 occur twice because they have two even factors other than themselves i.e 2 has 1 and 2 while 4 has 1 and 4 as its even divisors.

For example if we consider [3 , 5] both as [3 , 5] or [5 , 3], it must appear only once in our answer . Also note that order does not matter here so [3 , 5] is same as [5 , 3].

You can use memoization or dynamic programming technique to solve this problem.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. The function should be named as count_ways. The function should take an integer argument n which is the number of steps in the staircase and returns an integer value which is the total number of ways to reach top of stairs using either 1 or 2 steps at a time. If there are no stairs then return 0 as answer. If n is negative then return -1 as answer. For any other case, return -2 as answer indicating invalid input/answer for that particular case. The value returned from count_ways() should be stored in variable ans (use ans). Use print() statement to print ans on console after calling count_ways(). Note that you have not been asked to write main() but your code will be evaluated by executing main(). You can assume that there will be no whitespace characters before, after and between your input values (n). Also note that you have not been asked to write any test cases for this question so keep your code simple and clean without any unnecessary statements/variables/code blocks etc., which could interfere with correct evaluation of your code by our auto-evaluator! Also make sure that you don't print anything except ans on console since it might interfere with our auto-evaluator's evaluation process! Do not include any import statements in your submission since it will result in compilation error on our end during evaluation process! Your code should work for all valid inputs without throwing exceptions such as IndexError, ValueError etc., otherwise it will result in negative marks for this question! Please do not change variable name 'ans' since it is used by our auto-evaluator while evaluating your solution! Always use 'ans' variable name only if you want full marks for this question! Do not delete 'ans' variable since it is used by our auto-evaluator while evaluating your solution! For example: if n = 3 then value returned from count_ways() should be 3 because there are 3 possible ways as follows: 1",
