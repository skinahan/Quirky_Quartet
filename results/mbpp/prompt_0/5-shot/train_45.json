Write another function to find the sum and average for all even numbers between two given numbers. Write another function to find the sum and average for all odd numbers between two given numbers. Write another function to generate multiplication table for any number. The input should be read from standard input (raw_input()) and the output should be displayed as shown below (pay attention to spacing). For example if I enter 5 as an input then it should print multiplication table as shown below: 1 x 5 = 5 2 x 5 = 10 3 x 5 = 15 4 x 5 = 20 . . . 10 x 5 = 50 Task: Write python functions that solve above questions with proper documentation strings and comments wherever necessary. Note that you are not supposed to write any code outside these functions other than docstrings or comments inside these functions. Additional info: Think along the lines on how many variables you need? How would you access elements from data structures? What data structures would you use?

Ignore the case sensitivity and punctuations. Also, ignore the words that are not alphabets. Finally, print the words with their counts sorted by their counts in descending order. If two words have same frequency then print them in lexicographical order. For example for the given input sentence - \"You! Are you! You! You!\" The output should be - [('you', 4), ('are', 1)]Note that you need to write only python function and not the entire code. Also note that there is no need for additional comments or docstrings in this question as it will be evaluated based on your code alone without any documentation from your side. Think along the lines of variables and data structures to use for this problem. Also think about how you can access elements from these data structures etc., Do not hesitate to ask questions about this problem if you are stuck anywhere during solving it on our discussion forum at https://discuss.edugrad.com/ .
