The given cost matrix cost[3][n] stores the cost of painting nth box with 3 colors. The total cost of painting is the sum of costs of all boxes painted. You have to find the minimum cost to paint all boxes using at most 2 colors such that no two adjacent boxes have same color. A value k which corresponds to kth color should be added to cost matrix. Also, calculate how many ways are there to paint all boxes using at most 2 colors such that no two adjacent boxes have same color and print this count as well. Note : Since answer can be large take modulo 10^9+7 before printing answer. If no such way exists print \"-1\" (without quotes).\nTask:\nWrite a python function which takes input as shown below and returns output as mentioned in problem statement above, No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Additional info: Think along the lines of the variables and data structures that need to be used. Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures. Input Format : First line contains an Integer N denoting number of columns in a board Second line contains three space separated integers denoting values for first row elements in Cost Matrix Third line contains three space separated integers denoting values for second row elements in Cost Matrix Fourth line contains three space separated integers denoting values for third row elements in Cost Matrix Fifth line contains an Integer K Output Format : Return an integer corresponding with minimum possible total painting cost Return -1 if it is not possible Sample Input 1 : 4 1 100 100 100 2 1 10 10 1 Sample Output 1 : 6 Explanation Output 6 can be obtained by painting first box with blue color (2), second box with red color (1), third box with blue color(2) and fourth box with red color (1). Hence total cost would be = 2+1+2+1 = 6 There is only one way which gives this output i,e., by painting first three boxes blue and last box red so count will also be equal to one Sample Input 2 : 5 1000 1000",
