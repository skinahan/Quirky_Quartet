The longest consecutive element sequence is defined as the one which contains the most number of unique elements. If there are more than one such sequence present, then return any one of them. The order does not matter. For example, consider below list: [4, 6, 5, 2, 3]. It contains two sequences - [4, 5, 6] and [2, 3]. Since both have same length i.e., 3 elements in them and both contain 3 unique elements (i.e., 4 appears only once in sequence 1 and 2 appears only once in sequence 2), we need to return any one of them as answer (i.e., either [4, 5, 6] or [2, 3]). If there is no such sequence present in given list then output should be None/null/nil/Nothing. For example: Input: [5], Output: None Input: [5], Output:[5] Input:[3,-2,-3,-1], Output:[-1,-2,-3] Input:-[8,-7], Output:-[-7] Input:-[0], Output:-None Task: Write a python function to solve the above question .
