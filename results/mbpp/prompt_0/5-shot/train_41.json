If the length of the list is less than 2, return the original list. Do not use built-in methods or functions. For example, if input is [1,2,3,4], output should be [4,2,3,1]. If input is [5], output should be [5]. If input is [], output should be [] as well. You can assume that all inputs are valid lists. Note that you may not modify or create any other lists while solving this problem. Also note that you cannot use any built-in functions/methods like sort(), reverse() etc., to solve this problem. You can only use indexing and slicing operations to solve this problem. For example, for a given list lst = ['a', 'b', 'c'], lst[0] will give you its first element (i.e., 'a'), lst[-1] will give you its last element (i.e., 'c') and lst[1:] will give you all elements except its first element (i.e., ['b', 'c']). Also note that these indexing and slicing operations will work on other data structures such as tuples as well (for example tup = ('a', 'b', 'c'); tup[0] gives you its first element i.e., ('a'), tup[-1] gives you its last element i.e., ('c') and tup[1:] gives you all elements except its first element i.e., ('b', 'c'). You may also refer to https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction .html#lists for more details on indexing and slicing operations on lists.) Note that your solution must work with both Python 2 and Python 3 versions of Python language without any changes (except import statements). Your solution must also pass PyLint tool with zero errors before submission; otherwise it will result in deduction of marks from your final score regardless of whether your solution passes all test cases or not during evaluation after submission deadline has passed!
