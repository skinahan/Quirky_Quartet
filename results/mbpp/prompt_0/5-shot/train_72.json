Use recursion to solve this question.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\r\n\n    Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly. This technique provides a way to break down difficult problems into simpler problems and define complex problems in terms of simpler ones.\n\n    The following figure shows how recursion works with the help of an example:\n\n    Recursion Example - Fibonacci Sequence\r\n\n    In the above figure, you can see that the fibonacci() method calls itself until it reaches its base case (i.e., when n is 1). When it reaches its base case, it returns 1, which is then added with n \u2212 2 for every recursive call made before reaching the base case (i.e., n \u2212 2 + n \u2212 3 + n \u2212 4 + \u2026). This process continues until we get our final output as 8 (0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5).\n\n    Thus, when you use recursion for solving any problem, you need to make sure that your code has at least one base case and one recursive call that leads towards the base case eventually. If your code doesn\u2019t have these two things then it will go into an infinite loop and throw an error called Stack Overflow Error after exceeding its maximum stack size limit (which is quite small). It happens because every recursive call requires some memory space on the stack and there are only limited memory spaces available on the stack for each program execution unless you increase them by using some specific compiler flags while compiling your program. After exceeding this limit, your program will stop executing abruptly due to insufficient memory space on the stack for further recursive calls leading towards your desired output value or result! So be careful while using recursions!\n\n    You can also read about Python Recursion here! \r\n\n   Think along the lines of the variables and data structures that need to be used.

The function should return a list containing all possible values of sum. The number of elements in the returned list will be equal to N^3 where N is the length of input array. The returned list must be sorted in non-decreasing order. If there is no such triplet present then return an empty list. Look at the sample input and output for more details. Note that cube of a number 'n' is equal to n*n*n. For example, cube of 2 is 8 and cube root of 8 is 2. Also, you can assume that there are no duplicate numbers in the input array and each element occurs only once in it.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Also make sure your code runs without any error/exception handling (unless explicitly mentioned). You may use built-in functions available in python as per need but do not write your own implementations for them unless mentioned otherwise (for example, do not write your own sort method if you want to sort something). Do not use any external libraries or modules as well unless explicitly mentioned or asked for it (for example, do not use numpy library directly but you can use it indirectly by using some other built-in functionality). Finally, make sure your code does exactly what is expected from it without any side effects like printing anything on console etc., unless explicitly asked for it (for example, printing something on console as part of debugging may be fine but printing something on console just because you feel like printing should be avoided). Also note that this exercise does not require you to submit any test cases or test harnesses so don't worry about those things either :) . Assume standard inputs for all functions unless explicitly stated otherwise (for example, assume that function takes lists as inputs instead of strings if nothing else is specified). Finally, please do not write main method/function yourself if nothing else has been specified because we will invoke your solution with our own main method/function only :) .
