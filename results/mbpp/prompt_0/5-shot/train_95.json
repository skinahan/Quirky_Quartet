It can be imported from functools module by writing from functools import reduce . For example: reduce(lambda x, y : x + y,[1,2,3]) will return 6 . Here lambda is defining an anonymous or un-named function which takes two arguments x and y and returns their sum as output . And [1,2,3] is being passed as input list here . So it will add 1+2 first then 2+3 next so on until all elements get added together resulting into 6 as final answer being returned by this reduce() method call here .\n\n\tSyntax : reduce(function_to_apply , iterable , initializer)\n\n\tParameters : The first parameter represents a user defined anonymous or un-named function which is applied over each element of iterable along with initializer value if passed else it takes first element of iterable itself as default initializer value if not provided explicitly while calling this method otherwise accumulator initialized with initializer gets updated at each step with current element being processed at that instant time during iteration over iterable sequence till completion of iteration finally returning only one final result after processing all elements from start till end together at once by applying given user defined anonymous or un-named function over each element one by one including initialization also if specified else taking first element itself for initialization purpose in case no explicit initialization has been provided while calling this method otherwise accumulator initialized with explicit initialization gets updated at each step with current element being processed at that",
