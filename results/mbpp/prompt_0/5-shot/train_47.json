No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nThink along the lines of the variables and data structures that need to be used. Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures. Use list comprehension to solve this question. Do not use any other built-in functions or methods like filter() or map(). Also note that you can only use one for loop in your answer. You cannot use nested loops or if statements inside list comprehension. The input strings contain only lowercase letters and there could be duplicate letters in both strings so you have to consider them as well while writing your answer. The output should contain only lowercase letters without any spaces between them and should not contain duplicates even if they were present in either of input strings originally (use set() after list comprehension). For example, if str1 is \"abcd\" and str2 is \"cbda\" then your function should return \"ad\". If str1 is \"aabd\" and str2 is \"abdc\" then your function should return an empty string because there are no characters left after removing all characters from first string which are also present in second string. If either of two strings is empty then your function should return an empty string as well because there would be nothing left after removing all characters from it which are also present in another non-empty string (if any). If both strings are empty then your function should return an empty string as well because there would be nothing left after removing all characters from both of them which are also present in another non-empty string (if any). Please note that you need not take care of case sensitivity here i.e., 'A' == 'a'. You can assume that input strings will contain only lowercase letters without spaces between them and there could be duplicate letters as well so you have to consider them as well while writing your answer but output will always contain only lowercase letters without spaces between them and will not have duplicates even",
