The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13\u2026... And so on. The first two numbers are 1 and second number is also 1. To find the next number we add two previous numbers i.e., 0+1=1 and that becomes our third element of the sequence. Similarly we get all elements of this series by adding two previous elements except first two elements which are fixed as 0 and 1 respectively. Refer to wiki page for more information on Fibonacci series https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number . You can also refer to this link for more information about Fibonacci series http://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html . You can also refer to this link for implementation details https://www2a.cdcg...b-series-using-python . You may use additional libraries like math or numpy if required but they are not mandatory while solving this problem statement but you need to mention it while submitting your solution file as comments at top of your code file along with other imports if any used by you else your code will fail during automated evaluation process with error message 'import not found'. Also you need not write any additional utility functions other than what's mentioned in main function definition below else it'll throw an error during automated evaluation process with error message 'function not found'. Your code will be evaluated based on correctness of output produced by it against test cases provided by us and time taken by it against large input data set so don't try to hardcode output values instead write correct logic which will produce correct output values based on inputs given to your code against test cases provided by us during evaluation process which will be used by us both during evaluation as well as certification process after successful completion of challenge round on platform based on criteria mentioned above",
