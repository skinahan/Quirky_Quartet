A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers. For example 19 is Happy Number. The sequence goes as follows: 12 + 92 = 82 82 + 22 = 68 62 + 82 = 100 12 + 02 + 02 = 1.

Ignore whitespaces and case sensitivity. Treat spaces as an element. If input is \"hello world\" then it should return 7. If input is \"hello\" then it should return 4. If input is \"    \" then it should return 1. If input is \"\" (empty string) then it should return 0. Assume that the maximum length of the string will be 1000 characters and the string will not have any special character other than space and alphabets from [a-zA-Z]. For example, if input is \"Hello World\", output should be 7 and if input is \"HelloWorld\", output should be 9 (8 unique elements ignoring case). Note: Order of characters doesn't matter in this question. So, Hello World and World Hello both will give same output 7.
