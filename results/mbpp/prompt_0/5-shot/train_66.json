The function should return the element and its frequency. If there are multiple elements with same highest frequency, then consider the one which has lower value. If there is a tie between lower values, then consider the one which occurs first. Assume that all elements of input list are integers and they are greater than 0. For example, if input list is [1, 2, 1, 2], then output should be (1, 2) as both 1 and 2 have highest frequency of 2 but since 1 has lower value than 2, it should be returned as result. Similarly for input list [1, 2, 3] output will be (3, 1). For input list [4] output will be (4 ,1). For an empty list [] output will be None. Note that your function should not modify the input list as it is passed by reference to your function only and not passed by value.

The numbers can be positive or negative. Numbers present in the list can be repeated. You can assume that input list contains only numbers. Don't worry about the validity of input. You can use built-in functions to solve this question. Use one line of code to solve this task. Hint : Use sum() and reduce(). Also, refer functools module for more info on reduce(). You can import reduce from functools if required. Don't use any imports for this task, however you can use sum(), reduce() and len() functions from their respective modules as built-in functions. Also don't use any lambda function for this task, unless it is used as an argument to another function like map(), filter(), etc., which itself is not a lambda function (lambda functions used inside map(), filter() etc., are fine). If you are confused about what is a built-in function and what isn't, go through the first chapter of our course on Python Basics (Search 'Python Basics' on our website). The solution should be submitted using our online coding editor or upload a .py file with your code after you login/register on our website using the 'Upload' button provided at bottom right corner of every programming problem statement below its sample test cases section ('See Expected Output Format' section). You will get instant result after submitting your solution file along with other details like memory consumed and time taken by your program after submission ends (Note: It may take few minutes to process your submission as it has to run test cases against your submitted code online). If your solution passes all test cases then it will show 'Accepted' status otherwise 'Wrong Answer'. Click here for more info about how our online judge works and also read instructions given at bottom of every problem statement before submitting your solution file/code there. Note that you'll have to register/login before uploading any solution file there.)

If multiple elements have same frequency, then return the smallest element. For example, for the list [1,2,3,4,5,1] should return 1 and for [1,2,3,-4,-5,-4] should return -4. If there is no such element then return None. Also write a test case to demonstrate that your function works as expected. Use pytest library to write tests and assert to validate the output of your function. You can install pytest using pip install pytest command on terminal or command prompt. After installing you can run test by executing pytest <filename> on terminal or command prompt where filename is your python file name containing test cases (you can run all tests by running pytest without any arguments). Note that you need not submit any tests written using pytest library but only a single validator test which will be used to evaluate your code (tests written using pytest library are only for your reference). Also note that you need not submit any main method or other code which is not required while evaluating your code. Only submit a single python file with only one function definition and validator test case as explained above. You can also use assert statement instead of writing validator test case but if you do so then make sure that it throws AssertionError when an invalid output is produced from your function otherwise it will result in zero marks for this question even if it produces correct output for all other cases (see example below). For more details about assert statement refer https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-assert-statement . Note that we may use different input data while evaluating your code so make sure it works correctly for all possible inputs including boundary values like empty list etc., before submitting it on portal else you may lose some marks even if its correct answer gets printed on console when tested locally using sample input data provided here (we will use different input data while evaluating). Also note that we may compile and run your submitted code with python 2 version instead of python 3 version so make sure you are writing",
