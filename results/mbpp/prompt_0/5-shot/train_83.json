A sequence is considered monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are entirely non-increasing or entirely non-decreasing. A sequence with one element is considered monotonic. Two elements form a strictly monotonic pair when the first element is greater than or equal to the second element. A sequence with two or more elements is strictly monotonic if every pair of consecutive elements is strictly monotonic. It should return True if it is monotonic else False. Note: You can assume that all the elements in the list are int type and positive numbers only. Also, you don't have to write any additional code for input and output, just write your logic/function as specified in question description above and our test cases will automatically call your function when executed on our platform. For example: If input list = [6,5,4], then this list forms a strictly decreasing sequence and hence True should be returned by your function for this case. If input list = [6], then this list forms a strictly decreasing sequence and hence True should be returned by your function for this case as well even though it has only one element which makes it a special case of single element case mentioned above in question description where we say that such sequences are considered monotonic as well since they have only one element! If input list = [6,5], then this list forms a strictly decreasing sequence and hence True should be returned by your function for this case as well even though it has only two elements which makes it another special case of two consecutive elements mentioned above in question description where we say that such sequences are considered strictly monotonic if every pair of consecutive elements is strictly monotonic! If input list = [5,6], then this doesn't form any kind of strict increasing/decreasing pattern mentioned above so False should be returned by your function for this case! If input list = [5,4] + [7] + [10], then here we have 3 sub-sequences: (i) 5 > 4 which forms a strict decreasing pattern (ii",
