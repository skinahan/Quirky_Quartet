No additional comments and docstrings are needed. However, make sure that you use recursion while solving this problem. Also, don't forget to include necessary comments and docstrings as well as test cases wherever applicable (you can write your own test cases). The solution should be generic enough so that it can be applied on other inputs as well and not just limited to this input only (which means that you should not hard code anything). Also make sure that you use meaningful variable names and follow PEP8 guidelines while writing your solution (you can refer PEP8 here - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) .

No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Just write your code in Python 3 and submit it on our platform as your answer to this question! Additionally, do not write any other lines except for code inside the function body! If you have extra lines in your answer, then you will get an incorrect answer error while submitting it on our platform! Also do not use any print statements anywhere inside your code! Once again, if you use print statements anywhere inside your code, then you will get an incorrect answer error while submitting it on our platform! The only thing that you should keep in mind is that we have already imported math package for you so just directly use functions from math package wherever required instead of importing them yourself! For additional details please refer to sample I/O test cases below as well as final execution test cases section below them which will also be used by our assessment engine to check your answer against multiple test cases at once after submission is complete! Please note that these test cases will be different from sample I/O test cases shown below due to randomization involved in generating them but their format remains same as shown below! Also note that these final execution test cases won't be visible until after submission is complete so don't worry about seeing blank editor screen before submission is complete because it should look like this only before submission is complete and once submission is complete it should redirect back to problem page where you can see updated state showing execution status etc against multiple tests at once instead of single sample I/O case shown earlier because now we'll run against multiple final execution test cases instead of single sample I/O case shown earlier which was just",
