If the item is not found, return -1. The given list must be sorted. Do not use any built-in function or method to perform this task, write your own code to implement the binary search algorithm in python language. You are allowed to use slicing operation only once while implementing your code for this task and no other string operations like replace(), find() etc are allowed in your implementation. Also, you are not allowed to use any built-in methods or functions available in python for this task as well as any other programming language, write your own logic to implement the binary search algorithm in python language which should be generalised and should work for any list of integers/strings etc., (not just limited to the given list). You can assume that there will be no duplicate numbers present in the given list. You have access only to one variable named as nums which is a reference variable pointing towards the given list at any point of time during execution of your code and you can modify it accordingly but make sure that you restore its original values before submitting your solution otherwise it will lead to wrong answers and hence test cases failing due to wrong output for that particular test case even if they were correct earlier when you executed them locally on your machine (before modification). For example: nums = [1, 2, 3] # accessing elements using index notation # modifying elements using index notation nums[0] = 10 print(nums[0]) # prints 10 # modifying entire list using assignment operator nums = [10, 20, 30] print(nums[0]) # prints 10 You have also access only one variable named as item whose value is set by us before calling the function defined by you where it represents an element whose first occurrence needs to be found out inside the given input list (nums) using binary search algorithm implemented by you inside this function itself where we pass its value from outside while calling this function from our end after setting its value accordingly based on our test case input data file at runtime which means that it's value could be anything depending upon what we set inside our end before calling",

For example, if the input number is 7 (binary 111), then output should be 3, as longest consecutive set bits are 111. If input number is 15, then output should be 4, as longest consecutive set bits are 1111. And if input number is 12346, then output should be 1, as longest consecutive set bits are 1.  Note that we consider only contiguous set of bits and ignore the non-contiguous set of bits while calculating the longest consecutive set bit count. For example for input 12346, there are two sets of contiguous 1's in binary representation - 11 and 1; but we consider only longer one i.e., 11 and ignore other one i.e., 1 to calculate the length of the longest continuous set bit count which is 2 here for input 12346.  So your function must return 2 for this particular case when given argument value is 12346 (which is binary representation of decimal value 12346).   You can assume that all inputs will be valid positive integers only with at least one bit value as '1'. Also note that you don't need to check whether given integer is within allowed limits or not since it will always be within allowed limits e.g., 0 <= n <= 231-1 .   For better understanding see examples below:   Input Number : 7 (Binary : 111) Output : 3 Input Number : 15 (Binary : 1111) Output : 4 Input Number : 63 (Binary : 111111) Output : 6 Input Number : 127 (Binary 01111111 ) Output: 7 Input Number : 136583272442102112280123456789098765432123456789098765432100122334455667788991011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041424344454647484950515253545",

No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nThink along the lines of the variables and data structures that need to be used. Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures. Use only built-in functions and methods without using any external libraries/modules/packages. Use regex package only for splitting strings into words using whitespaces or any other characters as delimiters along with string slicing, indexing, etc., for solving this problem without using any external libraries/modules/packages. You can use len() function while implementing your logic as len() is an inbuilt python method and not an external library/module/package method. You can use sorted(), reversed(), join(), etc., which are built-in methods of list objects and not external library methods or functions for solving this problem without using any external libraries/modules/packages. You can use enumerate(), zip(), etc., which are built-in functions and not external library functions for solving this problem without using any external libraries/modules/packages. Hint: Use dictionary data structure to solve this problem without using any external libraries/modules/packages except regex package if needed while splitting strings into words using whitespaces or any other characters as delimiters along with string slicing, indexing, etc., for solving this problem without using any external libraries/modules packages except regex package if needed . Hint: Use list comprehension where ever possible instead of looping over lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, etc., with conditions inside loops where ever possible by avoiding writing long code inside loops by reducing it by applying conditions outside loops wherever possible as these will help you avoid writing long code inside loops which will also help you avoid writing long code outside loops when compared against your solution which has long code both inside and outside loops together by reducing it significantly when compared against your solution which has long code both inside and outside loops together by applying conditions outside loops wherever possible instead of writing them inside looping statements like while loop or for loop whenever applicable wherever applicable instead of writing them inside looping statements like while loop or for loop whenever applicable .
