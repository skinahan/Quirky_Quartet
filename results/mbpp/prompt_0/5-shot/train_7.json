You also need to ensure that you are not checking the divisibility of a number by itself - only by numbers below it. If you want to check whether a number is prime or not, it's better to check whether it has any factors up until its square root rather than up until its value. This is because if a number has any factors at all, then one of those factors must be less than or equal to the square root of that number (unless it is a perfect square). So you should try running your code with something like this instead:   <code>if n % i == 0 and i != n and i &lt;= math.sqrt(n)</code>. The following code would work properly:   <code>if n % i == 0 and i != n and i &lt;= int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1</code>. I hope this helps! :) Also, here's some more information on how prime numbers work if you're interested! https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/comp-number-theory/v/prime-and-composite-numbers . Good luck! :)   Here's an example of how your code should look:    import math    def is_not_prime():    result = False    for x in range (2, int(math.sqrt()) + 1):        if x % y == 0 and y != x and y <= int((math.sqrt()) + 1):",
