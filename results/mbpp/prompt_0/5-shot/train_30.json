Also think about the way to access the elements in the data structures.\r\n\n    The input list will contain duplicate integers as well as unique integers, e.g., [2, 3, 4, 2, 3]. The output should be a dictionary with key as integer and value as its frequency in the list e.g., {2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 1} for [2, 3, 4, 2 ,3].\n\n    Order of keys does not matter while comparing two dictionaries for equality using == operator (e.g., {1: 10} == {10: 1} returns True). But order matters when you iterate through a dictionary (e.g., for k in d returns keys in some order). So don't use dictionary == operator to test your solution but iterate over it instead and compare values one by one if you want to test your solution on your own machine before submitting it to us for grading purpose only!\n\n    If there is no element present in an input list then return an empty dictionary i.e., {} \n\n     Note that an empty dictionary is always equal to another empty dictionary (i.e., {} == {} returns True). However if you try printing them they will look different so don't get confused! We recommend that you first create an empty Python dict object by writing d = {} and then add key-value pairs one by one like this d[key] = value using square brackets notation because this way you can check what's happening inside more easily! For example try writing print(d) after adding each key-value pair into it so that you can see how it changes when new pairs are added into it! This will help debugging your code if something goes wrong! You may also use other methods like update() method or dict() constructor but don't forget about what we said above about printing dictionaries after adding items into them because otherwise",
