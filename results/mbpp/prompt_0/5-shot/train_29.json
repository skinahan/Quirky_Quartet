A string is said to be palindrome if reverse of the string is same as string. For example, \u201cradar\u201d is palindrome, but \u201cradix\u201d is not palindrome. Note: Ignore the case of all characters i.e treat upper case and lower case characters as same character for this question and use list slicing technique to solve this question. For example: \"Madam\" should be treated as \"madam\". Also ignore spaces in between the strings i.e treat \"m ada m\" as \"madam\". Also ignore punctuations in between the strings i.e treat \"mada!m\" as madam\". If input_str contains any other special characters like $%^&*()_-+={}[]|\\:\";'<>,.?/~` then output should be False (string containing any other special characters except space and ! are not palindromes). If input_str is empty then output should be True (empty string is considered as palindrome). If input_str contains only spaces then output should be True (spaces are ignored). If input_str contains only punctuation marks then output should be True (punctuation marks are ignored). If input_str contains only numbers then output should be False (numbers cannot form a palindrome). Note: Use list slicing technique to solve this question without using any builtin methods or functions except ord(), len() and range(). Please read about ord(), len() and range() before attempting this question by clicking on these words respectively underlined above or by searching on google/bing search engines with these keywords respectively followed by python keyword e.g., ord() python or len() python or range() python etc...
