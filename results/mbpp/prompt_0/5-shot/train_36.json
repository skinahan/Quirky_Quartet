(Perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors except number itself). The first few perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496 etc.. Hint : The divisors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. Example : Input : 28 Output : True Explanation : Divisors of 28 are 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 14 and 28 . Sum of these numbers is 56 which is equal to 28 so it is perfect number .
