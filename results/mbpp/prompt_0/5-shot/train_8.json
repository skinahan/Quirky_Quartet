You can use as many coins as you want. The order of coins doesn\u2019t matter. You can assume that there is infinite supply of each coin denomination. Also, you can assume that all coin denominations are positive integers. For example, if we have coin denominations 1, 2 and 5 and the value is 6, then there are four solutions: {6}, {2,2,2}, {1,5} and {1, 1 ,2 ,2}. So output should be 4 in this case. If we have coin denominations 1, 3 and 5 and the value is 11 then there are five solutions: {11}, {5 + 5 + 1}, {3 + 3 + 3 + 2}, {3 + 3 + 5} and {3 + 5+ 3}. So output should be 5 in this case. If we have coin denominations 1, 7 and 10 and the value is 14 then there are three solutions: {7+7} ,{10+4}and{10+1+3}. So output should be 3 in this case.
