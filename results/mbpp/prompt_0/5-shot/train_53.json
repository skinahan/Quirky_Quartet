The numbers in each sequence should be in ascending order and no two adjacent numbers should have common digits. For example, if k = 3 and N = 14 then possible sequences are {1, 3, 10} {1, 4, 9}, {2, 3, 9} etc.. You can write an additional helper function if required but do not modify signature of given functions. You may assume that N would always lie between 0 and 500 inclusive for this question. Do not assume any other conditions or constraints on input values other than those mentioned above unless explicitly stated so in problem statement or else your solution will fail during automated evaluation tests on our platform with hidden test cases which we use for validating your solution before announcing winners at end of contest period. Hint : Think about how you can re-use solutions for sub-problems when solving this problem using recursion? What are subproblems here? What are their inputs? How do they differ from each other? Can you make use of memoization while solving this problem using recursion? If yes then what is memoization technique and how it helps us improve performance here by avoiding re-computation of results for overlapping subproblems? Do you see any overlapping subproblem here which we can optimize away by storing its result instead of re-computing it again every time it appears again during recursive calls made by our program for solving larger input problems? Write down pseudocode for your idea before writing actual code as this helps you organize your thoughts better before starting with actual coding work on computer as well as makes it easier for others who read your code later on after some time has passed since you wrote it originally so that they",

So we use second formula here which is A[i-1]+B[i-2].  \t       #A=A+B and B=A+B as shown below in code snippet.
