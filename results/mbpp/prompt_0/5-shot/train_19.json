The longest common subsequence is not necessarily contiguous. It can be any sequence that is present in both the given strings. For example, \u201cabcde\u201d and \u201cace\u201d are subsequences of each other but not contiguous. Similarly, \u201cabd\u201d and \u201cceb\u201d are also subsequences of each other but not contiguous. If there are multiple common non-contiguous subsequences with equal length, then print any one of them. For example, if the two given strings are \"abcdgh\" and \"aedfhr\", then \"adh\" is one such non-contiguous longest common subsequence that has length 3 (not 4 because \"aef\" is not a valid LCS). If no such subsequence exists, then print -1. The answer may be printed in any order but it should be unique. Also note that a single character itself will always be a valid non-contiguous LCS for both the input strings as well as an empty string will also always be a valid LCS for both the input strings (if they contain empty string). So whenever you have doubt about your answer being correct or not, you can check whether your output contains these two cases or not to rule out any wrong answer due to incorrect implementation logic/typo etc..

Note that this link might change or expire after some time so please don't share it with anyone else and only use it when absolutely necessary (for example - when you want to check your answers online before submitting them on HackerEarth platform). You may assume that there will always exist at least one non-contiguous LCS between two input strings (as mentioned above). Both the",
