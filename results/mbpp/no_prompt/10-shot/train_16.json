Traversal is defined as moving from one element to another within the array. The points are calculated as sum of all the digits at each index. For example, given an array [1,2,3], and assuming we start at index 2, we have three options: move left to index 1 for a score of 2; move right to index 3 for a score of 3; or stay at index 2 for a score of 5. So in this case the maximum score would be 5. For another example: given an array [4,4,5,5], we can traverse from indices 0 -> 2 -> 4 for a total score of 8. So in this case the maximum score would be 8. If there are no elements in the array then print None as output. If there is only one element then print that element itself as output without any traversal required. Assume input will always be valid integer positive numbers and it will always contain at least one digit per number in string format separated by commas with no spaces between them e.g., \"1\",\"2\",\"3\". You may use Python's built-in functions to solve this problem but you may not use eval() or exec(). You need not check for any invalid inputs or exceptions handling etc., just solve it using some simple logic and clean code practices without worrying about edge cases etc., you need not write any test cases either except what is provided by default i.e., one test case with sample input/output mentioned below but your code should work on other inputs also which may not be explicitly provided here e.g., empty list etc.. Also note that your code should work on both Python version 2 and Python version 3 without any changes made to it except changing print statement syntax if needed i.e., you should use print() instead of print statement in Python version 3 where needed but make sure your code works fine on both versions before submitting it since our auto-gr",
