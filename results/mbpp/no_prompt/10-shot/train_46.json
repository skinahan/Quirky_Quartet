Return 0 if no items can be carried from the given list. Note: The answer will fit in a 32-bit integer. Given weights = [10, 20, 30], values = [60, 100, 120], capacity = 50 should return 220 as 60+100+60=220 is maximum value that can be carried with weight 50 kgs using Dynamic Programming approach.\r Task:\r Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\r Answer:\r def max_value(weights,values,capacity): \t\t#weights & values are lists and capacity is an integer value\t#calculate length of each lists\tlen1=len(weights)\tlen2=len(values)\tif len1 == len2:\tresult=[0]*capacity+[0]*capacity #initialize result list with zeros for i in range (len1): #iterate through both lists for j in range (capacity): #iterate through capacity if weights[i]<j+1 : result[j]=max(result[j],result[j-weights[i]]+values[i]) else : result[j]=result[j] return result [-1] else : print (\"Lengths do not match\") Question: Write a python function to check whether two strings are anagrams or not by ignoring spaces and punctuations marks in both strings by using Counter() method from collections module . Note : An anagram is nothing but rearranging characters in one string into another string by keeping their order same without changing case of any character or punctuation marks or spaces present between words .
