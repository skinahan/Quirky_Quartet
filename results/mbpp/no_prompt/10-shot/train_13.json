Also, find the line number of all occurrences of the string in the given text file. The function should return a dictionary which contains line numbers as keys and count of occurrences as values. Return an empty dictionary if there are no occurrences. If a line contains multiple occurrences of a word, then consider only one occurrence per line and ignore other occurrences on that particular line. Ignore case sensitivity while searching for a word and consider it to be present in all forms (upper case, lower case or mixed case). For example, if you search for \"E\", then \"e\" or \"E\" should be considered as present in all forms. Also, if you search for \"is\", then both \"Is\" and \"is\" should be considered as present in all forms. If there are multiple lines with same count value, sort them based on their corresponding line numbers before returning them as keys of dictionary (in ascending order). Note that there will not be any words which are repeated exactly same number of times across multiple lines (if at all such lines exist). In other words, each word will have unique count value across different lines (if at all such lines exist). Also note that input file may contain blank spaces or blank lines which should not be considered while counting words. Ignore leading and trailing blanks while comparing strings (while searching for a word). For example, if you search for \"is\", then both \" is\" and \"is\\n\\n\\r\\t \\r \\n \\t   \\t\\r\" should be considered as present in all forms.\"\"\"Task:Write a python function to solve the above question.
