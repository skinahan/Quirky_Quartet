Return the list of prime numbers. For example, if n = 5, then your function should return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]. Hint: Use recursion to solve this question. Note: The solution is not unique. There may be other ways to solve this question. But you need to implement a recursive solution only. Don't use any built-in functions or modules (like math and sympy). You can use nested if conditions and while loop inside your function body. Also don't use any global variables (variables declared outside of the function). You can't change the value of an immutable object (for example tuple) inside a function body (because tuples are immutable). If you try to do so, you'll get an error message as UnboundLocalError: local variable '<variable name>' referenced before assignment . So don't try to change the value of an immutable object inside a function body even though it's possible in Python. The reason for this restriction is that Python uses namespaces and scope resolution for variables in functions (you'll learn about them in Unit 2). If you want to read more about namespaces and scope resolution for variables in functions click here . Note that we have used doctest module for testing your code because it allows us to test your code by using examples within docstrings . These examples are written within triple quotes , usually after the function's opening quotes . You don't have write comments like test cases or sample input and output shown above after writing your code because they are already written within docstrings using doctest module which is by default supported by Colab Jupyter notebook (Google Colab supports many popular libraries including scikit-learn , pandas , TensorFlow etc.) For example see the below program which has two functions sq() and cube() : def sq(x): \"\"\" >>> sq(2) 4 >>> sq(-4) 16 \"\"\" return x ** 2 def cube(x): \"\"\" >>> cube(3) 27 >>> cube(-3) -27 \"\"\" return",

The function should returns true if the number is perfect else it should returns false. Note: In mathematics, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself. Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself). Example- The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2 and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128. Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer: def checkPerfectNumber(n): Sum=0 for i in range (1 , n): if n%i==0 : Sum+=i if Sum==n : return True else : return False print(\"Perfect Number\" if checkPerfectNumber(28) else \"Not Perfect Number\") print(\"Perfect Number\" if checkPerfectNumber(6) else \"Not Perfect Number\") print(\"Perfect Number\" if checkPerfectNumber(496) else \"Not Perfect Number\") print(\"Perfect Number\" if checkPerfectNumber(8128) else \"Not Perfect Number\") print(\"Perfect Number\" if checkPerfectNumber(123419) else \"Not Perfect Number\") Output: Perfect Number Not Perfect Number Not Perfect Number Not Perfect Number Not Perfect Numbe Question: Write a python function to remove all consecutive duplicates from string using stack data structure .
