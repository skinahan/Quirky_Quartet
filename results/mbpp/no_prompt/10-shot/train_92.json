Binary representation of 32 is 100000 After right shifting by 1 position, it becomes 010000 After right shifting by 1 position, it becomes 001000 After right shifting by 1 position, it becomes 000100 After right shifting by 1 position, it becomes 000010 After right shifting by 1 position, it becomes 000001 As you can see that after 5 shifts we get 000000 which means that the number is power of 2 in binary representation. Hence True will be printed as output for input 32.
