A number is considered abundant if the sum of its proper divisors is greater than itself. Sum of proper divisors means that we have to consider all divisors except that number itself and then find their sum. For example, 6 is an abundant number because its proper divisors are 1, 2 and 3 which sums up to 6 (1+2+3). Note that an integer n will be called abundant if and only if (sum of its proper divisors) > n . Otherwise it's called deficient number or perfect number .
