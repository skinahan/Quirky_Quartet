Return a new list with unique elements of both lists. The order of the returned list should be preserved. If there are repeated elements in both lists, they should appear as many times as it shows in both lists. If an element is repeated in only one list, it should appear only once in the returned list. If an element is present in both lists and is repeated, then it should appear only once in the returned list and not multiple times. The function takes two arguments - a and b as input parameters and returns a new sorted list which contains union of all unique elements of both input arrays including duplicates if any. Note: The order of output does not matter but you need to preserve the order for comparison purpose during test cases execution. You may assume that numbers are sorted in ascending order initially i.e., do not sort them before finding union or intersection or difference etc., Also assume that there are no duplicate numbers initially i.e., you can use sets to solve this problem but do not modify original array by sorting or removing duplicates etc., For example: Input 1: [2, 4, 5, 8] [3, 4, 5] Output 1: [2, 3, 4 ,5 ,8] Input 2: [3, 6] [3] Output 2: [3 ,6 ] Input 3: [] [] Output 3 : [] Input 4 : [1 ,2 ] [] Output 4 : [1 ,2 ] Input 5 : [-7,-5,-4,-1,-0 ] [-10,-9,-7,-6 ] Output 5 : [-10 ,-9 ,-7 ,-6 ,-5 -4 -1 0 ]\nTask: Write a python function to solve the above question using lambda expression and map() function without using any other functions like set(), intersection(), union() etc., No additional comments and docstrings are needed for this question solution code .
