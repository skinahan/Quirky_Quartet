Assume that you start at page 1. You are given three integers n, p and q where n represents the number of pages in the book, p represents the page number from which you start reading and q represents the desired page. If q > n then output should be -1. If p >=q then output should be 0 since no pages need to be turned.  For example if n = 20, p = 6 and q = 5 then your function should return 3 since we need to turn 3 pages in order to get from page 6 to 5. Similarly if n = 20, p = 5 and q = 15 then your function should return 4 since we need to turn 4 pages in order to get from page 5 to 15.  If there are multiple solutions print any one of them.   For example if n=10,p=5 and q=8 then either 3 or 2 is an acceptable answer(since we can turn three pages from 5-6-7-8 or two pages from 5-6-7-8).   You may assume that all inputs are valid numbers greater than 0 but less than 100000 .You can also assume that there will always be a solution for all input values i.e there will always exist a path between any two given pages irrespective of how many times you visit each page before reaching your destination . Your function must not modify its inputs i.e it must work with only input parameters as described above .You may use builtins/libraries/modules as needed but restrict yourself only using those functions which take O(1) time complexity for their operation .You may write additional helper functions as needed but do not modify any signatures of functions provided by us nor create any global variables .Your code will run against several test cases so make sure it doesn't fail against any test case after submission by clicking on \"Submit\" button on this screen.\"\"\"Task:Write a python function to solve the above question.\"\"\"No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\"\"\"Answer:\"\"\"\"import math\"\"\"def min_pages(n,p,q): \"\"\"",

The function should return 0 if there are no elements in the intersection. Use only built-in functions for comparing and sorting arrays. Don't use any libraries like numpy or pandas. The arrays can be of different lengths also. Assume that the input is well formed i.e., there are no null or empty arrays passed as inputs to the function. If any array is null or empty then return 0 from the function without failing with exceptions. If there are duplicate elements in an array then those should be counted separately while computing the intersection size (or cardinality). For example, if one array has [1,2,2] and another has [2,2], then their intersection has 3 elements namely 1, 2 and 2 (not 2 alone). Also note that we don't have to find common elements between two arrays; rather we just have to count them irrespective of whether they are common or not between two input arrays. For example, even if one array has [1] and another has [100], their intersection size is 1 because both have 1 element each irrespective of whether they are same or not (i.e., here 1 != 100 but still their intersection size is 1 because both contain only one element each). Also assume that all numbers in an array will always be greater than 0 i.e., you don't need to handle negative numbers in your solution code but you can assume that negative numbers won't be present in any input array passed to your function by test cases during evaluation (hence you don't need to handle exceptions due to negative numbers). You can assume that all inputs will be valid values i.e., non-null non-empty valid integer arrays consisting of positive integers only without any nulls or empty values inside it at any level inside it (you don't need to write additional code for handling malformed inputs; instead just focus on solving this problem by writing correct logic with built-in functions as explained above). For more clarity on what constitutes a valid input please refer examples below which demonstrate various scenarios with sample inputs/outputs along with explanations so that it becomes clear what exactly constitutes a valid input for this problem statement (i.e",
