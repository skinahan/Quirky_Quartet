The list is unsorted. The function should return the second largest number in the list. If there are no two largest numbers then it should return -1. Do not use sort function or sorted() built-in method. Only one loop through the list is needed. Using max() or min() built-in functions is not allowed. Use of inbuilt methods like index(), count(), reverse() etc are also not allowed. Do not use any other inbuilt functions as well. You can write additional helper functions if you want but do not modify the signature of this function, i.e., do not change def second_largest(list1): to def second_largest(list1, n): or def second_largest(list1, n=None). You can assume that all inputs are valid lists and integers (no None values). Also note that you cannot use global variables as well in your solution code to store intermediate results/values as they will be shared across test cases which will result in incorrect answers during evaluation of your code submissions on our platform when multiple test cases are run simultaneously on our platform for grading purpose on your submitted code solution for this question and hence your submission will fail with \u201cRuntime Error\u201d for such submissions with wrong answers due to global variables being used by you for storing intermediate results/values which will lead to incorrect answers due to their usage being shared across multiple test cases run on our platform simultaneously for grading purpose when evaluating your submitted code solution for this question and hence such submissions will fail with \u201cRuntime Error\u201d as result of wrong answers due to usage of global variables by you for storing intermediate results/values which will lead to incorrect answers due to their usage being shared across multiple test cases run on our platform simultaneously when evaluating your submitted code solution for this question and hence such submissions will fail with \u201cRuntime Error\u201d as result of wrong answer due to usage of global variables by you while solving this question which is prohibited while solving this question and hence such submissions using global variables while solving this question will fail with \u201cRuntime Error\u201d as result during evaluation when multiple test cases are run simultaneously on our platform during evaluation process while grading your submitted code solution against all test case inputs provided against each questions",
