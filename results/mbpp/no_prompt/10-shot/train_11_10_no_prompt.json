The input consists of two lines. The first line contains the value of money and the second line contains the values of coins available in this order (1, 2, 5, 10). You can assume that there are infinite number of coins for each type. If a solution is not possible then print -1 as output. For example, if amount = 4 and denominations = [2, 1], then output should be 2 as we need two coins with value 2 to get total value 4 with infinite supply available for both 1 and 2 denominations. If amount = 6 and denominations = [5, 10], then output should be -1 as we can not get total value 6 using any combination from infinite supply of both 5 and 10 denominations. Also if amount = 3 and denominations = [3], then output should also be -1 because it is impossible to have change when you have only coin for 3 denomination with infinite supply available for it. As another example if amount = 10 and denominations = [5, 7] then output should also be -1 because there is no way to get 10 using any combination from infinite supply of both 5 and 7 denomination coins even though sum of their values (12) is greater than 10 but they do not add up exactly to give 10 which is our required change amount so we can not use them in any combination even though they are greater than our required change amount which is why we print -1 as answer in this case too.. So your program must check all these cases before printing out answers.. You can assume that 1 <= n <= 1000000 where n denotes the value of money.. You can also assume that all coin values are distinct numbers i.e., no two coin types have same value.. You can further assume that 1 <= m <= 100 where m denotes size or number of different types or denominations available.. And finally you can assume that 1 <= d[i] <= 10000 where d[i] denotes coin type i-th having some finite positive integer finite non-zero positive integer value less than or equal to 10000.. So your program must check all these cases before printing out",
