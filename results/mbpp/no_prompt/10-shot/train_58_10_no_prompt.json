The output should be in the form of a tuple consisting of even and odd number counts. The input series of numbers should be passed as an argument to your function. For example, if your function is called as, find_even_odd(), you can call it by passing a list or tuple or set of numbers like this, find_even_odd([1,2,3,4,5]). In this case it should return (2,3). Note that the input is not provided to you here. You have to code that part as well. Also note that the order of numbers returned in the tuple should be (even count, odd count). For example if your function is called as find_evens() then you can call it by passing a list or tuple or set of numbers like this -- find-evens([1,2]) and so on. Here's one more example -- if your function is called as --find-evens(), then you can call it by passing a list or tuple or set of numbers like this --find-evens({1,-2,-3}), in which case it will return (0, 2). If no even number is found then the first element must be 0 and likewise for odd number also i.e., second element must be 0 when no odd number found in the given series/sequence/set etc., The order must always remain same i.e., (even count , odd count), for positive values only consider positive integers and likewise for negative values consider only negative integers.. If given an empty sequence/iterable then return (0 , 0) i.e., both elements are zero.. You may assume that all test cases will contain valid input only i..e., either empty sequence or non-empty sequence with valid integer values inside.. No need to check for invalid inputs..  Your solution will run against several different test cases with different input sizes so make sure that your performance scales appropriately depending on size of input data passed into your solution... Do not use any built",

Accept the input from user. The output should be displayed as float value with 2 decimal places. If the user enters anything other than number, display an appropriate error message. For example, if the inputs are 10, 20 and 30, then the output should be 20.0 and if any of the inputs is non-numeric or less than 0 or greater than 100 then display an appropriate error message like \u201cInvalid Input\u201d or \u201cInput out of range\u201d etc., accordingly. Use exception handling to solve this problem. Also use try-except-else block while reading input from user using input() function and print appropriate error messages accordingly by catching ValueError exception only (for non-numeric values). No additional comments and docstrings are needed for this question except for exception handling blocks. You can assume that all inputs entered by user will be valid integers only within 0 to 100 inclusive range (no need to check whether it is a valid integer or not). You can use python standard library functions int() to convert string type value into integer type value before performing numeric operations on it as shown below: num = int(\"10\") + 20 The above code will convert string type value \"10\" into integer type value 10 before adding it with 20 which will give 30 as output without any errors (no need to write our own code to check whether given string is convertible into integer or not). Note that we have used try-except block here just for demonstration purpose only but you don't need to use try-except block here again since we are using it already in our main code (don't write additional try-except blocks here again). You can also assume that all three numbers entered by user will be separated by space only (no comma separator is used between them). No additional comments and docstrings are needed for this question except for exception handling blocks. Use python 3 version only so that you can avoid any unexpected errors due to backward",
