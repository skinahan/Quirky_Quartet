An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3**3 + 7**3 + 1**3 = 371. Similarly, 153 is an Armstrong number since 1**3 + 5**3 + 3**3 = 153. You can assume that the input will always be a non-negative integer. The output should be either \"True\" or \"False\". Note: We have provided a template for your function in which you need to add only one line of code that checks whether the given input n is an Armstrong Number or not and returns True or False accordingly. Do not change any other lines in the code, otherwise your solution might not get accepted by our testing script. Please read carefully and understand what needs to be done before submitting your solution for grading purposes. Your function should take exactly one argument as input which will be a non-negative integer n (the given number). The output should be either True or False depending on whether the given input n is an Armstrong Number or not respectively (as mentioned above). Please do NOT print anything on the console while solving this problem, otherwise you will get a Runtime Error! Since this problem has been taken from HackerRank, we have already included some boilerplate code in order to make things easier for you! You can access it from here . If you are still confused about how to solve this question please go through this video tutorial . It explains everything clearly and shows you how to solve similar questions on HackerRank as well! Feel free to ask any questions in our Q&A forums . Good luck!
