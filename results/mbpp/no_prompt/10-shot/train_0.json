A string is said to be balanced if it has as many \u2018x\u2019s as \u2018y\u2019s and vice versa. If the string contains any other character apart from \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019, then it is considered unbalanced. The function should return True if the given string is balanced, False otherwise. Assume that the input string only consists of characters 'x' and 'y'. Do NOT use any inbuilt functions/methods related to regular expressions. You may use list comprehension in your code but do NOT use regex module (import re). Also, do NOT use any other built-in functions/methods related to regular expressions (such as re.search(), re.match(), etc.). Note that you will get a ValueError exception if you try importing regex module in your submission for this question on our online grader system due to security reasons as explained above. You can however test your code locally on your computer using an IDE or try it out on our sample test cases before submission on our online grader system by clicking on \"Run Code\" button provided below each question on this page after selecting Python3 as the programming language of your choice for this question before submitting your solution for grading by clicking on \"Submit\" button also provided below each question on this page after selecting Python3 as the programming language of your choice for this question.. For example, 'xxxyyy' is balanced but 'xxxyy' is not balanced since there are two extra y's compared to x's here.. Similarly, ''xyx'' is not balanced since there are two x's compared to y's here.. For example, ''yyyxxx'' and ''yyxyxxyxxyyyyxxxyxyx'' are balanced strings but ''xy'' and ''xxxxyy'' are unbalanced strings since they contain some other characters apart from 'x' and 'y'.
