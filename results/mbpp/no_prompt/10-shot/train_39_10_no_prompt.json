Two strings are called anagrams if they contain same set of characters but in different order. Note that characters need not be alphabets, it can be any character from any language including spaces, special characters etc., for example - \"abcd\" and \"dcba\" are anagrams but \"abcde\" and \"dcba\" are not anagrams as length of first one is 5 whereas second one has length 4. Also \"aabbcc\", \"aabbc\", \"aabbccc\", \"aaabbbccc\" etc., are all examples of anagrams since they all have same characters with different frequencies but in different order, however, none of them is anagram of each other because their orders differ from each other even though they have same set of characters with same frequencies (for example - frequency of 'a' is 2 for both the strings but its position differs). Also note that capitalization does not matter here i.e., a lower case character is considered to be same as upper case character hence you can assume that there won't be any capital letters in your input strings which simplifies your task quite a bit! For example - 'A' == 'a'. Your task here is to write such a program which takes two strings as input from user and tell whether they're anagram or not! So let's start writing our code now! Note that we'll use Python's built-in functions so you don't have to worry about those details and can focus on logic building only! You may also assume that both the strings will contain valid English alphabets (lowercase or uppercase) only i.e., no special symbols or numbers will",
