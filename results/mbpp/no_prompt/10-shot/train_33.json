Ignore case sensitivity. Display the result as a list of tuples in descending order of word counts. If two words have same count, they should be further sorted in alphabetical order. Assume that the sentence does not contain any punctuation marks. Perform case insensitive string comparisons wherever necessary. Include only alphabetic words (a-z and A-Z) in your analysis. For example, \"I love programming\" should be counted as two words \"I\" and \"love\". The output should be [('love', 1), ('programming', 1)] for this input sentence. Sample Input : I love programming with python Sample Output : [('love', 1), ('programming', 1), ('python', 1)] Note: Do not use built-in methods/libraries for string comparison or sorting or any other operations (assuming that you don't know python built-in methods are implemented using Timsort).

Return the count of occurrences of the pattern in the string. The pattern can overlap itself. For e.g., \u201caaaaa\u201d contains three \u201caaa\u201d, so it should return 3. If there is no match found, then return 0. Do not use any regex functions to solve this problem. Also, you need to handle cases like empty strings and invalid inputs appropriately and raise exceptions with meaningful messages wherever applicable. You are free to define your own exceptions as well for this problem statement if you want to (but it is not mandatory). Examples: \"abcabcabc\", \"abc\" -> 3 \"aaaaa\", \"aaa\" -> 3 \"abcdabcdabcd\", \"\" -> 0 \"\" , \"\" -> 0 None, None -> raise an exception with appropriate message \"abcd\" , None -> raise an exception with appropriate message None, \"abcd\" -> raise an exception with appropriate message Note that you need to find the number of occurrences of pattern in a given string and not vice versa (i.e., do not find number of occurrences of substring in pattern). The pattern can be any length and it can repeat itself zero or more times within a given string (i.e., you can have overlapping matches too). Also note that your function needs to be case sensitive i.e., \u201cAbc\u201d is different from \u201cabc\u201d and hence should be considered as two different patterns in this case even though they are same when compared ignoring their case i.e., both are same when compared after converting them into lowercase or uppercase respectively using lower() or upper() methods respectively for strings). Task: Write python code for the above mentioned function which returns count based on conditions mentioned above for any valid inputs passed into it by its users/callers i.e., your code should not crash for any input values passed into it by its users/callers regardless of what they pass as inputs including invalid ones like empty strings etc.. No additional comments and docstrings are needed here but make sure that your code works correctly without errors/exceptions for all valid input values passed into it by its users/callers",
