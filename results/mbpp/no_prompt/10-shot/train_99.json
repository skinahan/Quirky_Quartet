If it is not then print \"Not in Range\". Else print \"In Range\". Note that this code should work for any number. Use only if statement. Do not use any other statements. Write the function body only inside the function. Do not write anything outside the function body. Use the given skeleton and add your code inside it as mentioned above. You may use standard input/output to take input and display output (you can use stdin or open() functions). You can also write your own input taking and output displaying functions as per your requirement but you should not read or print anything outside the given skeleton or else you will get an error on submission. The answer will be checked using our code stubs so do not change any variable name or add extra variables in the skeleton provided below. Your answer will be evaluated on sample test cases so do not hardcode it with some fixed value of n while solving it locally as our test cases might have different values of n than what you have used while solving locally (we use random values). Also note that we are evaluating all submissions automatically, hence no partial marks will be awarded even if your program is partially correct (even though we might show partial marks while testing it locally). Hence please check your solution thoroughly before submitting it online otherwise you may get 0 marks for this question even though you have solved some part of this question correctly due to some small mistake which was undetected by you at the time of local testing but detected by our evaluation engine when submitted online for evaluation against test cases defined by us (this happens very frequently because we evaluate all submissions automatically using multiple test cases). We recommend that you solve this question using multiple approaches and submit all those solutions one after another so that at least one solution gets accepted from your side after evaluation against multiple test cases chosen randomly by us from a large pool of possible test cases since each approach might get rejected due to some small mistake which was undetected by you at the time of local testing but detected by our evaluation engine when submitted online for evaluation against test cases defined by us (this happens very frequently because we evaluate all submissions automatically using multiple test cases).
