For example, 3/2 = 1 not 1.5 as in normal division operator \"/\" \r\n\n    return True;\n\n  #another method using bitwise operator \"&\" , which compares two bits and returns 1 if both bits are same else it returns 0. This is also known as \"bitwise AND\" operator and denoted by \"&\". For example: 5 & 6 ---> 4 , since 0101 & 0110 ----> 0100 . This is similar to logical AND operation which is denoted by && and compares two conditions and returns true if both conditions are true else it returns false . For example : 5 && 6 ----> true , since 5=true and 6=true . In python we can use this like : True && True ----> True , False && False ----> False etc.. Here we have used this bitwise AND operator to get last bit of number n using expression \"n&1\". If last bit is 1 then it means number has odd no of 1's in its binary representation i,e., number is odd else even no of ones i,e., number is even. Then we have right shifted the given number by one position using expression \"(n>>1)\" to get next bit from last bit position and then repeated this process until all bits are traversed through all positions from LSB till MSB for given integer n . If at any point we found that there exists a single set bit among all unset bits then that means given integer has only one set bit so its power of 2 otherwise not power of 2 . We have used expression \"(count & count-1)\" which will unset last set bit from count",
