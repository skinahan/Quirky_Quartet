It is case sensitive, that is 'A' and 'a' are considered different characters and both can be repeated characters at different positions of the string. If all characters are distinct then it returns \"\\0\". If there are more than one repeated characters then it returns only one of them based on their position from left to right, that is if there are two or more repeated characters but they occur at different positions then only one of them is returned based on their position from left to right (the one which occurs earlier). For example : In case of input string \"abcbda\", it returns 'b'. In case of input string \"abcdaef\", it returns 'a'. In case of input string \"abcdeafg\", it returns 'e'. In case of input string \"aaaaaa\", it returns 'a'. In case of input string \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyza\", it also returns 'a' because although there are multiple occurrences but all occur at later positions than the occurrence at index 20 (zero-based indexing).

We iterate through every possible center of palindrome below.   We also keep track of length of longest palindrome seen so far in \"maxlen\" variable below.   This is used to optimize our program - we can stop iterating as soon as we find a palindrome longer than our current longest palindrome seen so far (since we know that our final answer can't be shorter than this).    This optimization reduces time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2).  For more details, see https://articles.leetcode.com/longest-palindromic-substring-part-ii/ .   Also see Tushar Roy's video on Manacher's algorithm for linear time solution https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbTSfrEfo6M .     Note that I have not implemented Manacher's algorithm here because it is non trivial and beyond scope of this problem which is meant to test basic programming skills rather than advanced algorithms knowledge (which will be tested in later rounds) .  So I have stuck with brute force approach here which should be sufficient for this round but you are welcome to implement Manacher's algorithm if you wish! :-)     Note that since we don't know whether input string contains non alphabet characters or not, we will use Python \"re\" module below to strip out all non alphabet characters before proceeding further with processing input string s .     Also note that since Python strings are immutable, we need temporary variables \"left\" and \"right\" below which hold left and right indices respectively while processing each possible",
