Return 0 if there is no such substring. For eg: \"aabbcc\", k = 1 should give \"aa\". K = 2 should give \"aabb\" and so on. If there are multiple such substrings of same length, then return any one of them. For eg: \"aabbcc\", k = 3 should return \"aabbcc\" or \"bbcca\" or any other such string of length 6. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. You can assume that all the characters in the given string are lowercase English alphabets only (i.e., 'a' - 'z'). Assume that there is no space character in the given string and you do not need to consider escape sequences (like \"\\n\", \"\\b\", etc.) while solving this question. You can write additional helper functions as required but this function has to be written from scratch by you and cannot use any existing implementation of it as available in libraries/built-in modules (also not by using python's eval() function). You can write utility functions and test your code using test cases we provide or create your own for local testing, but when we evaluate your code, we will use only the function name as defined above without any helper functions around it (not even default arguments). Also note that if you have written multiple solutions for this question, then we will take into account only the solution provided in last submission made by you before deadline/end date of this assignment is over and ignore rest of your submissions for this question on Gradescope after deadline/end date has passed even if they have better score than last one submitted by you before deadline/end date is over on Gradescope which will be considered as final score for this question on Gradescope after deadline/end date has passed from now onwards until end date is reached which will be considered as final score for this question on Gradescope after deadline/end date has passed from now onwards until end date is reached which will be considered as final score for this question on Gradescope after deadline/end date has passed from now onwards",
