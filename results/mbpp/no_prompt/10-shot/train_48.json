Answer: from collections import Counter def anagramOrNot (text1 , text2 ) : dic1 = Counter ( text1 ) dic2 = Counter ( text2 ) if dic1 == dic2 : print \"yes\" else : print \"no\" Question: Write a program that takes two lists as input and returns True if they have at least one common member otherwise False using set(). Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer: def isCommonMemberInTwoListsUsingSetFunction(): listOne=[] listTwo=[] result=set() isCommonMemberInTwoListsUsingSetFunctionFlag=False numberOfElementsForListOne=(int)(input(\"Enter Number Of Elements"
