Answer: def isAnagram (str1, str2): n1 = len(str1) n2 = len(str2) if n1 != n2 : return 0 str1 = sorted(str1) str2 = sorted(str2) for i in range (0,n1): if str1[i] != str2[i]: return 0 return 1 Question: Given an array of integers write a python function that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a^2 + b^2 = c^2 Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer: import math def PythagoreanTriplet (arr): for i in range (0 , len (arr)) : arr [i] = arr [i] * arr [i] arr.sort() for i in range (len (arr)- 1 , 1 , - 1): r = arr[i] j = 0 k = i - 1 while j < k : if arr[j] + arr[k] == r : print (\"Yes\") else : print (\"No\") break else : j += 1 k -= 1 Question: Given an array of integers write a python function that returns true if there is any triplet with 0 sum Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.
