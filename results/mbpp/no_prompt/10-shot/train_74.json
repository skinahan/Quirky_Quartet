Use filter function to filter out non-numeric values. The function should accept the list of numbers and returns only numeric values as output. Use reduce function to find the maximum number from the filtered data. Do not use max() built-in function to solve this question. Also write test cases for your program. The solution should be generic i.e., it should work for any type of iterable inputs (tuple, set etc.). For example, if input is [\u2018ab\u2019, \u2018cd\u2019] then output should be None and if input is [1, 2] then output should be 2 etc. Note that you are not allowed to use any built-in functions or methods for this question except filter(), reduce() and len(). Also note that you are not allowed to use lambda functions here i.e., you have to write a normal python function only which can be called from within lambda expression passed as argument to filter() or reduce(). You may assume that all inputs are valid and well formed (no invalid inputs like empty lists/tuples/sets etc.).  Hint: You can use __gt__() method defined in int class for comparing two integers (if one integer is greater than other or not). For example, 1 > 2 will return False and 1 > 0 will return True etc.. This method can also be used with other types like string etc.. For example \u2018ab\u2019 > \u2018aa\u2019 will return True and \u2018aa\u2019 > \u2018ab\u2019 will return False etc.. See here for more details on this method: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__gt__ Task: Write a python program using above constraints mentioned in problem statement with test cases included as mentioned in problem statement above (test cases are important). No additional comments and docstrings are needed anywhere in solution file except code comments which you may write wherever necessary but no need of docstrings anywhere else in solution file including main block of code (i.e., your program).
