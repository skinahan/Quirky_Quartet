The function should not use any loops. The function should return an integer value. Assume that all the characters of the given string are lowercase alphabets. Do not use any built-in functions/methods related to strings. You may use built-in functions/methods related to lists. Hint: Think of base case and recursive case and then write the code using recursion. Also, please note that you may not use any global variables or mutable default arguments and you may assume that we will not call this function with an empty string as input from the test cases below (if you wish to test your code with an empty string, there will be no problem). Also, please note that you may only submit one attempt for this question (no reattempts are allowed for this question). You can submit your code as many times as you want for all other questions before their deadlines have passed (and reattempt if needed). Note: Your solution will be tested on some additional test cases by our graders after the deadline has passed; make sure your code works correctly on arbitrary input values! Also, note that submission of your solution after the deadline has passed will trigger re-evaluation of your solution (and hence change in your scores) on all remaining questions; make sure you submit well before the deadline passes! Return type is int and it should be 0 if input is None or '' else it should return length of given string using recursion only without using any loop or other built-in methods related to strings except list().

If the substring is not found, return 0. Ignore case sensitivity. Ignore the characters \u2018 and - when counting the number of characters. For example, if the given string is \u201cIt\u2019s a man, it\u2019s a plane, it\u2019s superman!\u201d and substring is \u201cit\u201d then your program should return 3 as output.

You can use any built-in function available in python to solve this question except count or find method or using regular expressions which are not allowed for this question. You can write additional code outside of given function to solve this question but you cannot change signature of given function i.e., you cannot change name of given function or add any additional parameters to this function . Use count_substring method from previous question to solve this question . For example if you have written code for count_substring method in previous question then copy that code here and call that method from within your solution for this problem with appropriate arguments passed to that method . The only restriction is that you cannot use count or find methods or regular expressions in python which will be treated as cheating while evaluating your submission so please take care while writing code for this problem .     Task : Write python3 code without using any built-in methods except upper() , lower() , split() , replace() , len() methods from python standard library i.e., do not use any other built-in methods from python3 except these five built-in functions mentioned above .
