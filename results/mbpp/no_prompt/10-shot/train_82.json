The number will be given as input to the program. The output should be the sum of all the digits in that number. If the input is 12345, then output should be 15 (1+2+3+4+5). If no number is provided as an argument, then your program should raise an exception with an appropriate message. You can use either built-in functions or user defined functions to solve this problem. Hint: Use modulus and floor division operators to get all digits from right side one by one and add them up in each recursive call. This can also be solved by converting the given number into string and iterating through each character to get their ASCII code value and adding them up. But this will not work for large numbers because strings are immutable in python and any change on string results into new string object creation which is not efficient memory wise. So try solving it without using strings at all! And also do not use any global variables while solving this problem! Note: Do not use any built-in function or library function like sum() etc while solving this problem! Also do not convert the given number into string as mentioned above! Try again if you have already tried that approach! You can write additional helper functions as needed but do not modify signature of given function definition! Also you can write additional classes if required but again do not modify signature of given class definitions! Also note that input may or may not be integer type so consider all cases while coding your solution! And lastly try to solve it yourself before checking answer hint link provided below!!
