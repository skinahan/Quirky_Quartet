The given list will be sorted and there are no duplicates in it.  You can modify the given list itself.   If there is no missing number then return an empty list else return a sorted list of missing numbers.   Example: input_list = [2, 3, 1, 8, 2, 3, 5, 1], output_list = [4, 6] and input_list = [2, 4, 1, 2], output_list = [3].   You can assume that the given input lists will always have unique elements only and they will always be in ascending order only.   You cannot use any built-in functions/methods to solve this problem except for append(), insert(), sort() methods of List class (if you want to use sort() method then you should not modify original input list).  You can write your own sorting method or algorithm to solve this problem but you cannot use any python built-in sorting methods/algorithms like .sort(), .sorted(), etc.. Also do not use any built-in functions/methods like .index(), .find(), etc.. Your function should run in O(n) time complexity where n is length of input_list parameter i.e., len(input_list).   Note that your code will run against several test cases so make sure that it works fine for all possible test cases (i.e., if n=1000 then your code should work fine even for very large lists). Do not hardcode any values inside your program i.e., do not hardcode length of input lists etc.. Also do not create new lists inside your solution function because it makes our evaluation process more difficult as we need to recreate those new lists before running them against our test cases i.e., we cannot just pass those new lists directly into our solution function as arguments because we need to create them first from scratch (just like how user would create them). So please avoid creating new lists inside your solution function otherwise it may lead to unexpected errors during evaluation process when we",
