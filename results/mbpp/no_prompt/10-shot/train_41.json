(n and k are positive integers). Note that the order of elements in a combination matters i.e., if n = 4 and k = 2, a valid combination is (1,2), but (2,1) is not considered as a valid combination. Also note that the same number should not be repeated more than once in any combination e.g., (1,1,2) is invalid but (1,2,3) is valid. The function should return None for invalid input values or when there are no possible combinations.
