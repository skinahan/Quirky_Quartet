The output should be a tuple containing two elements. If the given list is empty then the output should be None. Assume that there will be no duplicate elements in the input list. Refer to the test case for more details. Do not use built-in functions/methods. Hint: Use bubble sort algorithm to solve this problem. You may create other functions as well if required. Do not use any in-built function/methods for sorting or reversing, etc.. Note: Use only one loop for this exercise; do not use any other loops like while, for, etc., and do not create lists, etc., just operate on the given list using bubble sort algorithm (refer to lecture notes). Write your own code for bubble sort algorithm and implement it here without using any built-in function/methods (like sorted(), reverse(), etc.). Also write your own code to check whether two numbers are equal or not instead of using == operator (which is already provided below). Refer sample input and output for details. Note that input list may contain negative numbers as well as positive numbers (both) and zero also; hence you need to handle all these cases accordingly by writing proper logic which can work with both positive and negative numbers as well as zero also (all three cases). Also note that after sorting, you need to compare first two elements of sorted list with each other first, then compare second two elements of sorted list with each other next, then third two elements of sorted list with each other next till last two elements of sorted list with each other; so you need to write proper logic accordingly which can work correctly even when there are odd number of elements in input list (i.e., number of elements are odd); also note that when there are even number of elements then last element will remain unprocessed but it does not matter because we have already found maximum and minimum from first n - 1 items only where n is total count of items in input lisr which was passed by user at runtime; so we can ignore last element here because we have already found maximum and minimum values from first n -",
