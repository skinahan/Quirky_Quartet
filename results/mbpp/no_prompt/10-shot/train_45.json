If there is no smaller element on the left side, print -1. Consider the first element as leftmost element. The array may contain duplicate elements. If all elements are equal then print -1 for all of them. The output should be printed in a single line separated by spaces. The input will be read from STDIN and output should be printed to STDOUT. Expected time complexity is O(N). Expected auxiliary space is O(N). (Note that you are not allowed to use any extra space like arrays, lists or dictionaries for storing the results)   Note : You have to write a complete function which takes two arguments as input and returns nothing but prints the result in standard output stream as mentioned in problem statement above. Also you are not supposed to change main method or any other methods provided by us in code stubs section. Example 1: Input: arr = [4, 5, 2, 10], Output : 4 2 -1 10 Example 2: Input: arr = [3, 2, 1], Output : -1 -1 -1 Example 3: Input : arr = [2], Output : -1 Sample Test Cases Input\tOutput\tExplanation\tTC#3\t4 5 2 10\t4 2 -1 10\tFirst element has no smaller value so we print '-1' on its left side and then we find next smallest number on its left side which is '2' and so on...
