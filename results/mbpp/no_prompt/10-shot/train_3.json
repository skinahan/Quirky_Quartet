An anagram of a string is another string that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, \u201cabcd\u201d and \u201cdabc\u201d are anagram of each other. Assume that all characters in the given strings are lowercase alphabets only and no whitespace or special character is present in them. If two strings contain different number of alphabets then they cannot be anagrams by definition, so return false in that case as well. The input strings will contain only lowercase alphabets only and no whitespace or special character is present in them.. As per wikipedia \u2018An anagram is direct word switch or word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag-a-ram\u2019 . If there exists one such string return True else False . Note : If you use sorted() on list it will always returns sorted list irrespective of original order , if you need original order then use sorted(listname , key=listname .index). Use this link for more info about sorted(). You can also use your own logic for sorting like bubble sort etc.. It should be case sensitive i.e., \u2018abc\u2019 and \u2018Abc\u2019 should not considered as anagrams..
