For example, if the input is 3, then output will be 4. Refer below diagram for more details.   Note that all dominoes are placed vertically in above diagram. The actual problem is to count the number of ways to fill a 3 x n board using 2 x 1 dominoes. For example, for a 2 x n board, there are three ways as shown below.   If we consider a more general case where we need to find the number of ways to fill m X n board with 1 X m dominoes then the recurrence relation becomes  T(m,n) = T(m-1,n) + T(m-1,n-1) + ... + T(m-1,0).   As we can see from above recurrence relation that this problem has overlapping subproblems and it can be solved using Dynamic Programming approach by creating an auxiliary array and storing intermediate results so that they can be used directly if same subproblem is encountered again (See this post for more details). Below is Dynamic Programming based implementation for finding number of ways to fill m X n board with 1 X m dominos (Tiling Problem).\n\n Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.
