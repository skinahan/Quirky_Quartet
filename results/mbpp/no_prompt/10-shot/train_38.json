Return True if the string is palindrome, else return False. Do not use any in-built methods/functions to check palindrome. Palindrome strings are those, where string s and its reverse is exactly same. For example, \"abba\" is palindrome, but \"abbc\" is not palindrome. Do not consider punctuation marks and spaces, for example \"Madam\" and \"madam\" are both considered as palindromes here. You can ignore cases too while checking for palindromes i.e., you can treat uppercase and lowercase letters as same character while checking for the palindromes. Do not use any in-built methods/functions to check whether the input number/string is a prime or not . The task here is to write your own logic to check whether a given number/string (input from user) is prime or not . For example 19 , 23 , 41 , 47 etc are prime numbers whereas 20 , 22 etc are non-prime numbers . Similarly 'a' , 'A' , 'N' etc are non-prime characters whereas 'b' , 'B' etc are prime characters . You can assume that the input will always be an integer or string . Hint : Use two loops - one loop iterating from 0 to len (input)-1 and other loop iterating from len (input)-1 to 0 (both inclusive). Compare each character of input with its corresponding character in opposite direction using temporary variables . If all characters match then it's a plaindrome otherwise it's not a plaindrome . In case of numbers you can compare each digit of input with its corresponding digit in opposite direction using temporary variables till half of the length of input has been reached because after that all digits have been compared with their corresponding digits in opposite direction already . Note : Don't forget to convert all uppercase letters into lowercase letters before comparing them with their corresponding lowercase letters otherwise they won't match even if they represent same character because ASCII",

The pattern can overlap with itself. Both pattern and text consists of lowercase letters only. The function should return a list containing all starting indices of the pattern in the text. If no match is found, an empty list should be returned. For example, if text = 'abababa' and pattern = 'aba', then starting indices are 0, 2 and 4 (0-based indexing). If text = 'abababa' and pattern = 'abc', then an empty list is returned since there is no match. For example, if text = 'abcde' and pattern = 'cde', then starting indices are 2 (0-based indexing). Note that we need to find all occurrences of the given substring in the string which can overlap with itself. So for this case, [2] is not enough as answer but you need to return [2,4]. You may use built-in functions or write your own code to solve this problem. If you use any built-in functions from standard libraries such as re module, you will get a zero mark for this question even if your code gives correct output for some test cases but not all test cases. You may assume that 1 <= len(text) <= 1000 and 1 <= len(pattern) <= 100000 so that naive algorithms work within time limit on our machines. If your code runs within time limit on our machine but gives TLE error on codewars website due to huge input sizes used by codewars servers, it will be graded as correct solution because it works fine on our machines although it might not give correct output when run on codewars server due to TLE error caused by huge input sizes used by codewars servers (which are much larger than what we use). We have provided sample test cases below so that you can check whether your code works fine or not before submitting your solution for grading purpose only; however note that these sample test cases are NOT exhaustive inputs which cover all possible corner/edge cases; so passing these sample test cases does NOT guarantee full marks for this question since there might be some corner/edge cases which were not covered by these sample",
