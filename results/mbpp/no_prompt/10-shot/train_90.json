So, this approach is better than other approaches as this approach has less time and space complexity as compared to other approaches. This approach also uses less code lines thus making it easy to understand and implement. This approach is much faster than other approaches because it uses less code lines thus saving time during execution of code and also saves memory because it uses only two arrays instead of three arrays which will be used otherwise if we consider temporary array or variables. Thus this approach is better than other approaches in terms of both time and space complexity as well as in terms of ease of implementation due to use of less number of code lines which makes this approach easy to understand and implement when compared with other approaches which use more number of code lines making them difficult to understand hence difficult to implement such approaches when compared with this approach which has very few code lines making it easy for a user or developer who wants to implement such program or algorithm . So, overall this approach is better than all the other approaches that could be used for solving such problem statement or algorithm . So , I recommend you people should definitely use this approach",
