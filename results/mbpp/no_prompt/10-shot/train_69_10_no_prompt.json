The array is unsorted. Note that your answer should be a number, not an array. For example, if the input is [1,2,3,4], and k is 3, then we have 1+2+3=6 as the maximum sum for 3 consecutive numbers. If k is 4 then we have 2+3+4=9 as the maximum sum for 4 consecutive numbers. If k is 5 then we have an empty set as there are no 5 consecutive numbers in the array. You can assume that k is always valid and fits in the range of natural numbers (1 \u2264 k \u2264 length(array)). The first input variable contains an integer n denoting the size of input array and second variable contains n space separated integers denoting elements of array A = [a1,...aN]. Third variable contains an integer K which denotes number of elements to be added consecutively from starting index to get maximum possible sum from given sequence. The output should print a single integer which denotes maximum possible sum from given sequence by adding K consecutive elements from starting index . In case it's not possible to add K consecutive elements because there are less than K elements available in sequence then print -1 as output. Note: Make sure you don't add any extra newline or space after printing output otherwise you will get Wrong Answer verdict even though your output will be correct otherwise. Example Input/Output 1: Input: 6 2 3 4 8 9 10 3 Output: 23 Explanation: Here N = 6 A[] = {2, 3, 4, 8 ,9 ,10} and K = 3 So here we have N-K+1 = 6-3 + 1 = 4 subarrays {2}, {3}, {4} and {8} Maximum Sum among these subarrays will be 23 (which can be obtained by adding 8 + 9 + 10) Example Input/Output 2: Input: 7 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 2 Output:-1 Explanation: Here N = 7 A[] = {11 12 13 14 15 16",
