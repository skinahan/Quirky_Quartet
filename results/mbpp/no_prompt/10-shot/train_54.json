If the number is negative, then add 1 to it and take the absolute value. Repeat this process until you get a single digit number. For example if the input is -9, then output should be 8 because -9 + 1 = -8 (absolute value of -8 is 8). Similarly if input is 9, then output should be 9 because 9 + 1 = 10 (absolute value of 10 is 1). If input is 0 or negative numbers with single digit like -2, then return 0 as output. If input is positive numbers with single digit like 2, then return 2 as output. For more information on this problem refer to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sum-digits-number-recursively/.
