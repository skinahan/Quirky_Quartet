Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7. Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAnswer: \r\n\n   def isUgly(num):\r\n        if num <= 0 : return False\r\n        for i in [2,3,5]:\r\n            while num % i == 0:  # divide by 2 3 5 until not divisible by them anymore and then check if the result is 1 or not , if yes then it's an ugly number else it's not .\r\n                num /= i   # this line does the division and updates the value of num accordingly . So for example first time we enter the loop with say 48 , so we divide 48 by 2 , 24 , 12 , 6 , 3 and then exit from loop . Now we have entered again in loop but this time with 3 which gets divided only once by 3 so now we have 1 left as value of num . After exiting from loop we check weather 1 or not equal to 1 or not and so on... :) :) :) :) :) :) Hope you got it ! ! ! ! !   :P :P :P :P :P ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;D ;D ;D ;D ;D     </code>\n\n\n\n",
