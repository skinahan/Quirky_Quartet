A palindrome is a word which is same when read forwards and backwards. For example 'madam' is same when read forwards or backwards. Another example 'level' is also same when read forwards or backwards. If there are multiple palindromes with longest length, return the first one occurring in the given string. Write your python function to return the answer as indicated in the description above. Do not print anything in the function. Also if multiple answers are possible then return any one of them. Note that you can only traverse each character once while solving this problem and hence you cannot use any other data structure like dictionary, list etc for storing information about characters already processed or visited etc. You can assume that all characters are lowercase letters only ('a' to 'z'). Do not use any built-in functions/methods for solving this question except for those mentioned above in this description (like len()). Also do not use any built-in modules (like collections). You can write additional helper methods as needed but do not change method signature of given helper method nor add/delete/change parameters of existing methods and their signatures. You can import standard python modules like math but don't import anything else from external sources (like pip installable packages). Do not use global variables unless specified otherwise below (see exceptions). Also note that your code will be auto graded so do not add extra input statements or print statements anywhere in your code (otherwise it may interfere with our auto evaluator). We will test your code against custom hidden test cases after submission so think about edge cases carefully before submitting your solution (for example what happens if input string contains only one character?). If you feel that some particular case is missing from our test cases then please let us know by raising an issue on our discussion forum with title \"Missing Test Cases - <question_name>\". We will try to address such issues within 2 business days whenever possible and update grade accordingly after reevaluating affected submissions manually within 5 business days after issue has been raised on discussion forum by you.\"\"\"\n\n \ndef longest",

The function takes two arrays of integers as an input and returns the maximum sum. You can assume that all elements in the array are non-negative integers and both arrays are of equal length. The maximum sum path is the sum of elements from first array to second array which are picked from same indexes. For example, if given arrays are A = [5, 6, 7, 8] and B = [3, 2, 4, 5], then output will be 11 since 5+6+7+8=26 and 3+2+4+5=14 but 26 is greater than 14 so output will be 26. Note: You can only move forward i.e., you can only increment index value by 1 at each step not decrement or any other number. If there is no such path then return -1.

Answer: def max_sum_path(A, B): if len(A) == 0 or len(B) == 0 or len(A) != len(B): return -1 else: result = [] for i in range(0, len(A)): result += [A[i]+B[i]] return max(result)\n\n\n\n Question: Write a python function which takes a list of positive integers as an input and returns the largest number formed by joining these numbers together as a string without any consecutive zeroes between them (in case of multiple such numbers present in the list choose any one).

If there are no consecutive 1's return 0. For example for the number 13 the binary representation is 1101 and so the function should return 2. Also for the number 28 it is 11100 and hence the function should return 0. Note that we have not performed any type checking etc., so your code should work with integers only. Also note that you can assume that all inputs will be positive integers only. You may use additional variables but you cannot use any other data structures such as lists, dictionaries etc., You may not import anything either; Note however that you can use built-in functions such as bin(). Also note that your function will be tested with different inputs so make sure it works for all positive integer inputs without exceptions or errors. You may also assume that there will be no leading zeroes in binary representations of numbers i.e., if the input is 5 then its binary representation 101 has no leading zeros and thus we do not need to consider 001 or 00000101 etc., Finally note that your code will be graded manually so make sure it is readable and understandable by humans too! We are looking for simple, clear solutions without fancy one-liners or esoteric hacks! Please avoid using very long lines (> 80 chars) in your code as it makes reading harder!

If the two numbers have no common digits, return -1. Note that all given numbers will be positive integers, and they will not have leading zeros. For example if the two given numbers are 12 and 23, then your function should return 2 because both of these numbers contain a 2 digit. Similarly if the two given numbers are 1238 and 823 then your function should return 1 because both of these numbers contain a 3 digit. If no common digits exist between them, then you should return -1. This problem is also known as the Longest Common Digits problem. Assume that all inputs are valid positive integers with no leading zeros. You can assume that there will be at most 10^5 digits in any input number (this means it can fit into an integer). You can also assume that there will be at most 1000 inputs to your function. Hint: Convert each integer to its string representation so you can iterate through its characters more easily with a loop. Then use some sort of nested loop structure to compare characters between each input number's string representation (you may want to use Python's built-in zip() function). Use another data structure such as a dictionary or array/list to keep track of how many times you've seen each character so far while iterating through both strings simultaneously with zip(). Finally, after processing all characters from both strings you'll need to find out which key from your dictionary has occurred most often and report its value as your final answer (the maximum number of common digits between any two input values). Your algorithm must run in O(N) time where N is equal to the combined lengths of all input strings (e.g., for 1000 inputs each with 100000 characters would make N=100 million total). It also must use constant O(K) space where K is equal to some small constant value such as 10 or 20 or 30 etc (i.e., don't use an array/list/dictionary whose size is proportional to N!).
