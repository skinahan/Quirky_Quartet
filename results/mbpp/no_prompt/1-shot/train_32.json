If no such number exists, return -1. Assume that the array is non-empty. Do not use any built-in methods or functions to solve this question. You can use a single loop only. Use the following signature of function: def first_odd_number(array) where array is an integer list and returns an integer value which is either an odd number or -1 if no such number exists in the list. For example, if the input array is [2, 3, 4], then output will be 3 and if it's [2, 4], then output will be -1 because there are no odd numbers in this array. Note: Your code should work for both positive and negative numbers as well as zeros present in the given list without any errors/exceptions/bugs for all kinds of inputs/edge cases. You can assume that all inputs are valid (e.g., integers). Also note that we have already provided some sample test cases to test your code on our end; however you may add more test cases to further test your code on your end as well but do not change our test cases since they're used by us to evaluate your code on our end during grading process!
