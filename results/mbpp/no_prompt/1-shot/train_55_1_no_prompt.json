You can use built-in functions in Python 3 for this task (like zip(), map() etc). You may also use list comprehensions if you know how they work (with or without lambda). Note that you should not use any other functions like find(), count() etc which may help you solve this problem in an instant but will not help you learn the concept well enough to apply it in your own code later on! So avoid using them at all costs! And do not worry about efficiency either as we will take care of that later on in the course after we learn about complexity analysis and some more advanced concepts! :) Just focus on solving it first and then try to optimize later on if you have time left! :) Good luck! :)\nAnswer:\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  def lcs(str1, str2): \r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 if len(str1) == 0 or len(str2) == 0: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 return \"\"\n\u00a0 \u00a0 else: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 n1 = str1[0] + lcs(str1[1:], str2) # recursive call 1\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 n2 = str2[0] + lcs(str1, str2[1:]) # recursive call 2\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 n3 = lcs(str1[1:], str2[1:]) # recursive call 3\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0if len(n3) > len(n2): # compare lengths of n3 and n2                                       return n3                                                                elif len(n3) < len(n2): # compare lengths of n3 and n2                                       return n2                                          elif len (n",
