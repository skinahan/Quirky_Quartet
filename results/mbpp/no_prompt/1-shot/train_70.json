The longest consecutive element sequence is defined as for any given sequence S = {a1, a2, ..., an}, S is said to be consecutive if for any i=1, ... , n-1, ai+1 = ai + 1. The sequence length is defined as the number of elements in the sequence. For example, the length of sequence {7, 2, 3, 4} is 4 because it contains 4 numbers with consecutive values.
