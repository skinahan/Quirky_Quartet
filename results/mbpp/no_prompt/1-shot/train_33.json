The input list can contain duplicate elements. Handle the possible errors and exceptions in your code. (For example IndexError, ValueError) Hint: Use try-except block. Note: Avoid using built-in functions or methods. For example sort(), sorted(), index(). Assume that the input list is not empty. Also assume that k is valid, i.e., 1 <= k <= length of the list and return None if there are no such elements in the list. If there are multiple such elements present return any one of them as output. For example if input_list = [5, 5, 4] and k = 2 then output should be 5 else if k = 3 then output should be None since there are only 2 distinct elements in input_list (4 and 5). You can write additional helper functions as needed but do not modify the signature of given function which is already provided to you for testing purpose only. You may assume that all inputs are valid and handled appropriately within main(). Also you may use python built-in sort() or sorted() method to sort lists but do not use their index() method to find indices of multiple occurrences of an element as it defeats the purpose of writing your own code to solve this problem without using built-in methods/functions or their combinations directly or indirectly! If you want to get marks for performance then please note that time complexity should be O(nlogn) at least where n is length of given input_list (but it's ok if your solution has O(n^2) time complexity). Note: Please read Python documentation for more information about try-except block and about other built-in functions mentioned above which you cannot use directly or indirectly! Also note that this question does not require any object oriented design principles so do NOT create classes unnecessarily! So just stick with simple procedural style programming using functions only! Feel free to define additional helper methods/functions as needed but do NOT change given function signature because our auto grader will give 0 marks for this question if we detect any changes made by you without our permission! Even though we have written test cases with different values for n",

You can assume that the input will be a valid positive integer. For example if the input is 111101111 then your function should return 4 as there are four consecutive 1\u2019s in this number. If there are more than one such substrings with equal length then you need to return the length of first such substring. For example if the input is 11100111 then your function should return 2 as there are two substrings with equal length of 2 each but you need to return only the first one. If there is no such substring then your function should return 0. Note that for an empty string your function should also return 0. For example if the input is \u2018\u2019 (empty string) or '0' (a zero) or '00110011' (all zeros) then your function should also return 0 as there are no 1's in these strings at all. Hint: You can use built-in functions bin() and len(). Also you can use string methods like startswith(), rfind() etc.. You may also write additional helper functions as needed. You may create new variables / objects as required but note that total runtime complexity must be O(n). Here n refers to length of binary representation of input number which can be found using len(bin(n))-2 . For example when n=10 , bin(10) gives \u20180b1010\u2019 so len(bin(10))-2 will give 4 which is correct length of binary representation 1010 . Similarly when n=16 , bin(16) gives \u20180b10000\u2019 so len(bin(16))-2 will give 5 which is correct length of binary representation 10000 . Note that here we have subtracted 2 from result since we don't want to count '0b' prefix while calculating length and since prefix remains same irrespective of value of n , it does not affect overall runtime complexity which remains O(n). It means that total time taken by your code must be proportional to longest possible value for given size b . So if b=4 bits, time taken by code must be same for",
