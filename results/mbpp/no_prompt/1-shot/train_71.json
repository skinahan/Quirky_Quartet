The function takes in a number and returns the factorial of it. If the input is not an integer then return -1. If the input is negative then return -1. For all other cases return the factorial of the number. Note that 0! = 1 (0 factorial) and 1! = 1 (1 factorial). Also note that you need to first import math module in your solution code before using any logarithmic functions from it as they are not part of core python library. You should also round off your answer to only 3 decimal places and return it as float data type value. Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications. Also note that math module has been imported in code stub below for your convenience so you can use log10() function directly without importing it again in your code solution. However you can still use other functions from math module if you wish to do so.  Note: Factorial is denoted by ! symbol in mathematics i.e., 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24  Similarly 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120  So on...  Hint: Use recursion or while loop or for loop accordingly based on how you have approached this problem earlier while learning loops or recursion concepts etc., Use pow() method from math module to find exponentiation of numbers i.e., pow(2,3) will give 8 which is equal to 2^3 Use log10() method from math module to find base 10 logarithm of numbers i.e., log10(1000) will give 3 which is equal to log base 10 of 1000 Use round() method from built-in python library round off values upto specified decimal places i.e., round(4/3) will give 1 where as round(4/3,2) will give 1.(33333...)3 Task Write a python function def findFactorial(number).
