It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For instance, here is a Caesar cipher using a left rotation of three places (the shift parameter referred to as \"key\"):Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZCipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWWhen encrypting, an input letter xis replaced with an output letter yby means of this equation:(x + n) mod 26 = ywhere mod 26 means that we take remainder on division with 26 (i.e., if x + n > 26 then we subtract 26 from x + n).Decryption works similarly:(y - n) mod 26 = xand again we take remainder on division with 26.(Note that for decryption we use -n instead of +n). Write Python functions for encryption and decryption using Caesar Cipher algorithm as follows:(a) EncryptMessage() - This function takes two parameters - messageTextand shiftamount . It returns encrypted text based on Caesar Cipher algorithm.(b) DecryptMessage() - This function takes two parameters - encryptedTextand shiftamount . It returns original text based on Caesar Cipher algorithm.(c) main()- This function contains code to perform following tasks :i.) Ask user whether he wants to encrypt or decrypt ii.) If user enters 'e' then ask him for plaintext and key valueiii.) Call EncryptMessage() with messageTextand key valueiv.) Print",
