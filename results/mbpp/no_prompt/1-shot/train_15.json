The output should be as a sorted list of tuples. The first element in the tuple should be the character and the second element should be the count of that character. Ignore case sensitivity while counting characters. For example, for the string \"Python\" your function should return [('h', 1), ('n', 1), ('o', 1), ('p', 2), ('t', 1), ('y', 1)]. If two characters have same count, then order them according to their ASCII values. For example, for string \"python\" your function should return [('h', 1), ('n', 1), ('o', 1), ('p', 2), ('t', 1)] or any other such list with similar order of tuples. Hint: You can use dictionary comprehension or use counter from collections module to solve this problem. Note that you are not allowed to import any module and implement this functionality yourself using a dictionary or counter object as well as their methods like get(), most_common(), etc., Also note that you are not allowed to use any built-in functions like sort() or sorted(). You have to write your own code for sorting output list according to ASCII values. Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.
