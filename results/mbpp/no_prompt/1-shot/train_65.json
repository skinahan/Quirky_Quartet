(Palindrome are strings that look the same even if you reverse them) E.g., \"madam\" is a palindrome. \"hello\" is not a palindrome. (Ignore case) E.g., \"Madam\" and \"madam\" are palindromes. Hint: Use slicing to solve this question in one line of code. Answer should be True or False accordingly. Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer: def is_palindrome(string): return string == string[::-1] Question: Write a function that takes an input as list of numbers and returns the median of all numbers in list as output (if number of elements in list are odd then median will be middle element, if number of elements in list are even then median will be average of middle two elements). Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed Answer: def find_median(lst): lst = sorted(lst) n = len(lst) if n % 2 != 0 else n+1 m = int((n+1)/2)-1 return sum(lst[m-1:m+1])/2 Question : Given an unsorted array which has all distinct elements, find two numbers such that they add up to target value given as input?
