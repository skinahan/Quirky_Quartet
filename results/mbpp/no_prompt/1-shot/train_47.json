The room can accommodate only if the heights of all the students are distinct. The input is given as two lists, one containing student names and the other containing their heights in meters. Maximum number of students that can be accommodated is equal to the length of list after removing all duplicates from it. If there are no duplicate elements then return -1. If both lists are empty then return 0. If any one list is empty then return -1. Note: Ignore case while comparing two strings and also assume that all the string inputs contain only lowercase characters a-z and uppercase characters A-Z . For example: if first list is [\"sam\",\"SAM\",\"tom\"] and second list is [1.7 , 1.7 , 1.6 ] then output will be 2 . Here sam and SAM are considered as same name with same height so they are counted as one student but tom has different height so he will be counted as another student . Hence total two students can be accommodated in this case . Both lists contains 3 elements but here we have 2 distinct elements ( names ) so output will be 2 . Similarly if first list contains [\"sam\",\"SAM\",\"tom\"] and second list contains [1.7 , 1.8 , 1.6 ] then output will be 3 because here we have 3 distinct elements ( names ). Task: Write a python function to solve the above question which accepts two lists as input parameters and returns an integer value denoting maximum number of students that can be accommodated according to above rules or conditions mentioned above or -1 if there are no duplicate elements present in both lists or any one of them is empty or None . No additional comments/docstrings should not be written along with your code except docstring for your function definition which must describe clearly about what your function does taking inputs from user along with its type information i e whether it takes two integer lists or float lists etc .
