Return true if it is a perfect square else return false. If the input is not an integer return None. For example, 8 is a perfect square but 8.5 and 10 are not. Also, -8 is not a perfect square because squares are always positive integers. Input: 8 Output: True Input: -8 Output: None Input: 8.5 Output: None Input: 10 Output: False Answer : def find_square_root(number): if number <= 0 or type(number) != int : return None elif number**0.5 == int (number**0.5) : return True else : return False Question : Write a python function to check whether the given number is prime or not? Return true if it is prime else false Note that 0 and 1 are not prime numbers and negative numbers are also not prime numbers except -2 which is considered as prime by convention Input : 2 Output : True Explanation : 2 is the only even Prime Number Input : 3 Output : True Explanation 3 is Prime Number as well as Odd Number both Input 9 Output False Explanation 9 can be divided by 3 hence it's composite Answer def check_prime (num) if num <= 1 or type (num) != int then return False for i in range (2, num//2 + 1) then if num % i == 0 then return False else continue # End of for loop # End of Function Question Write a python function to find the maximum possible sum of some of its k consecutive numbers (numbers that follow each other in order). The function should accept positive integers n and k as parameters and returns an integer representing the maximum possible sum of k consecutive digits from number n . Note that consecutive numbers need to be next to each other in order for their sum to be added up together e g 123456789 has 9 consecutive digits from 56789 to 23456789 both included But 123456788 does NOT have 9 consecutive digits from 56788 to 23456788 since 5678 appears at",

A number is said to be a sparse if in the binary representation of the number no two or more consecutive bits are set. The binary representation of 6 is 110 and that of 4 is 100, so 6 and 4 are sparse numbers. But 5 is represented as 101 in binary and hence it\u2019s not a sparse number. Similarly 10 which is represented as 1010 in binary is also not a sparse number. Note that every even number whose binary representation ends with 0, for example 100 and 1000 are all sparse numbers. Similarly, every odd number whose binary representation ends with 1, for example 1111 and 11101 are also sparse numbers. Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.

If the array contains other arrays or sub-arrays, they should be added up recursively. Note that if an element is itself an array, then it is not added. The given array may contain positive and negative numbers, but not strings. For example: [1, 2, 3] should return 6 and [[1], [2], [3]] should return 6 too. The given array can also be empty or None or NoneType value in which case your function should return 0. You do not need to worry about invalid inputs (data types). If you are using Python version 2+, please note that we have changed input() to raw_input(). So you will have to accept inputs using raw_input() and not input().
