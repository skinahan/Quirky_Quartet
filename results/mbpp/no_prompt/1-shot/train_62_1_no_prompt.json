This is done because we need to replace more than 'k' elements and hence we'll have more than 'k' unique elements after this step too which means we still need to replace some elements even after shrinking so do this as long as you find replacing character count > 'k'. This loop will break when you have replaced all extra characters and now your sliding windows has exactly 'k' unique characters which means you'll not be able to replace any more",

You can either take one or two steps at a time. The function should return an integer value corresponding to the number of ways you can climb the staircase using either one or two steps at a time. For example, if there are 4 steps in the staircase, you can reach the top in 5 different ways: 1+1+1+1, or 1+2+1 or 1+1+2 or 2+1+1 or 2+2.
