Return true if they have at-least one common member, otherwise false. Do not modify contents of lists passed as input arguments; assume that they are copied before being passed to your function (so that you needn't worry about modifying them). Also, do not use any built-in functions except min(). You may use 'is' operator to check object identity (but that is not necessary). Examples : Suppose list1 = [10, 20, 30], list2 = [20, 40]. Then your function should return True since both lists have 20 as their element; Suppose list1 = [10, 20], list2 = [30]. Then your function should return False since both lists don't have any common elements; Suppose list1=[], list2=[20]. Then your function should return False since both lists don't have any common elements; Suppose list1=[10], list2=[10]. Then your function should return True since both lists have 10 as their element; Task : Write a python program/function which takes two arguments (which can be either numbers or strings), and returns True if they have at least one common member else False without using sets or any other built-in functions (except min()",
