The substrings should not overlap. The output should be sorted in increasing order of their lengths. If two substrings have same length, then they should be sorted in increasing order. Return a list containing the count of all palindrome substrings along with their lengths. If no palindrome substring is found then return an empty list. For example, if input string is \"aba\", then output list will be [(1, 1), (3, 1)]. Here (3, 1) means that there are three palindrome substrings of length 1 and they are \u201ca\u201d, \u201cb\u201d and \u201ca\u201d respectively. Similarly (1, 3) means that there is only one palindrome substring of length 3 i.e \"aba\". Note that single characters are considered as palindromes here even though they are not strictly speaking palindromes since they have odd number of characters but for the sake of this question we will consider single characters as palindromes here also for simplicity's sake. Your function should not modify contents of input string in any way as it is passed by reference to your function and you may assume that input string contains only lowercase alphabets without any spaces or punctuation marks or digits etc.. Also you may assume that input does not contain any leading or trailing whitespaces or line breaks etc.. You can use standard library functions for this question but you cannot use recursion directly or indirectly to solve this question because recursion will result in time limit exceeded error due to exponential complexity involved with it so avoid using recursion completely for this question and also do not use any built-in python library functions like find() etc.. Also note that we have already provided some test cases to test your code so do check them first before submitting your code on our platform otherwise you might get wrong answer verdict even if your logic is correct because sometimes our test cases might miss corner cases which you might have handled",
