Ignore case sensitivity while comparing. Return empty list if no match found.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. The function should be named as finder(). The input and output should be as given in the example below. For example, finder([1,2,3,'a','b','c',1,'A',3], 1) should return [0, 6]. Similarly finder([1,2,3,'a','b','c',1,'A',3], 'A') should return [6] and so on for other inputs also. Assume that all inputs are valid (non-empty lists). Assume that all elements of input lists are hashable i.e., they can be used as keys in dictionaries or sets or used as elements of tuples which themselves may be elements of other tuples etc., Also assume that there are no nested lists or dictionaries inside the input lists that you receive from test cases/user input etc., You need not perform any type checking for your solution code but you may use assertions to check for valid inputs if you wish to do so (this is optional). You need not handle exceptions/errors if any (if any). Use assert statements only for validating your code's inputs and never use them to handle exceptions/errors or control program flow etc., If you wish to write additional helper functions then you may do so but ensure that these functions are called from within your 'finder' function only and nowhere else because otherwise it would lead to errors due to scope issues during test case execution by our testing engine (ScopeGuard). Note that we will provide only one argument which is a non-empty list while calling 'finder' function during evaluation i.e., we will not provide any element value whose indices have to be searched inside the provided non-empty list argument passed by us during evaluation i.e., this element value will vary according to",

If the list is empty, return 0. The list can contain negative integers, zeros and positive integers.   For example, if input is [1, 2, -3, 1], then output should be 3 (which is 1 + 2). If input is [1, 2, 3], then output should be 6 (which is 1 + 2 + 3). If input is [-1,-2,-3], then output should be 0.  If input is [0,-2,-3], then output should be 0.  If input is [-1,-2,-3], then output should be 0.   The solution must run in linear time (O(n)).  You are allowed to use only constant space (O(1)) and no other data structures such as lists or arrays or dictionaries etc., are allowed to solve this problem. You can assume that the given list will always have at least one element and you do not need to check for edge cases such as null or empty lists etc., while solving this problem.   Do not modify the contents of the given list; you must use only constant space (O(1)). Also do not print anything in your code; we will check only your returned value against correct answer when grading your code. Hint: Think of Kadane's algorithm which was discussed in class recently for finding maximum sum subarray from a given array of integers with negative numbers also allowed in it but without any restriction on space complexity i.e., O(n) was required for time complexity but there was no restriction on using additional data structures like lists or arrays etc., But now you cannot use any additional data structure; you have to solve this problem using only constant space i.e., O(1). Also note that here we are looking for maximum sum of consecutive elements from a given list whereas Kadane's algorithm finds maximum sum subarray from a given array which may or may not contain consecutive elements as its part but overall it looks for maximum sum",
