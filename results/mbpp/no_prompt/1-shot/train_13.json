The function should return an integer value. If there is no element in the list within the given range, then it should return 0. The input list will be sorted and all the elements will be distinct. Note that low and high are inclusive here. For example: if input list is [1, 3, 5], low = 1 and high = 5 then output should be 14 (since 1 + 3 + 5). If input list is [2, 4, 6], low = 1 and high = 10 then output should be 12 (since 2 + 4 + 6). If input list is [2, 4, 6], low=5 and high=10 then output should be 0 since there are no elements between 5 to 10 in this case. You can assume that all the inputs are valid integers only i.e., you don't need to check for any None or string inputs or any other invalid inputs etc., Also note that you don't need to check for edge cases such as empty lists etc., You can directly start solving this problem by writing your code from first line onwards without any test cases or handling exceptions etc., Also note that you can write additional helper functions if required but you cannot change signature of given function i.e., it's name and parameters only which is already provided above along with their types and order as well as return type of given function which is also mentioned above so make sure not to change these while writing your solution otherwise your solution may not get evaluated correctly by our system even though it may compile successfully so please take care about this point while writing your solution as well otherwise you may lose points even though your solution passes all test cases on your local machine but fails during evaluation due to signature mismatch issue so please keep this point in mind while writing your solution too otherwise you may lose points unnecessarily due to this reason only so please take care about it too while working on this problem carefully without making any silly mistakes",

The values are to be stored as per the given weight and capacity of the bag. If the weight is greater than capacity, then ignore that value and move to next element. The list can contain duplicate values too. Also if there is no element that satisfies the condition, return -1. Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function or inbuilt method for this question. You can write your own code for finding maximum value which satisfies given condition and store it into a variable maxval and return it from your function using return maxval statement at end of your code after indentation (if you have written your code correctly).
