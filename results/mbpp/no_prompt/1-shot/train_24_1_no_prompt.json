Use list comprehension to solve the problem. Note that you must not use any inbuilt functions for computing the list difference. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. You can use set() function only once in your code. No other function is allowed to be used. You can use set() only once in your code, anywhere you want, but not more than once!  Example: If input_list is [1, 2, 3, 2, 4], then output_list must be [1, 3, 4]. If input_list is [2], then output_list must be [2]. If input_list is an empty list ([]), then output_list should also be an empty list ([]). Do not import any library functions other than those which are present by default in Python installation. Note that you cannot convert the given list into a set and then back to a list; doing so will result in loss of information about duplicates and hence will result in failure of this test case. Note that the solution provided here does not satisfy all requirements of this task; it is just for illustration purposes! Also note that we have provided some test cases for debugging purpose only; passing these test cases does not guarantee that your code will pass all test cases including hidden ones!
