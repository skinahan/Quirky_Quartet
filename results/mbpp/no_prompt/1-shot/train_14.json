The substrings are not overlapping. If the substring occurs more than once, it should return an array of all the indices where it is found. Else it should return -1. For example, if the string is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" and substring is \"the\", then your function should return [4, 33]. Note that 'the' at index 4 and 'the' at index 33 are not overlapping. If the substring is \"dog\", then it should return -1 since 'dog' occurs only once. Also note that case matters here, so 'The' and 'the' are two different words. Assume that you can use any built-in functions or libraries to solve this problem except for regular expressions (re). Use list comprehension wherever possible to solve this problem. Do not use any other looping construct like for or while for solving this problem as well as no other built-in functions except for len(). You may use str() and type() functions if necessary though they are not necessary to solve this problem. Write your own code without using any external library or built-in function except those mentioned above (str(), type(), len()). You may write additional helper functions but they must be tested with your own test cases along with the main program given below by us before submission on Gradescope . Please do not change any existing code provided by us in this template file as it will affect your grade negatively on Gradescope . You can add additional test cases inside main program below if you want but make sure that you don't break our existing test cases which we have already written for you inside main(). Please include comments wherever necessary to explain what your code does exactly so we can understand it easily when grading your assignment . We will deduct points from your grade if we don't understand what exactly your code does because of lack of comments or bad variable names etc., so please make sure that you include proper comments wherever necessary! Also follow proper python style guidelines while writing code like using snake case instead of camel case naming convention etc., Your python solution must be compatible with Python 3",

We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest. If there are no repeating elements, then print \u201c-1\u201d (without quotes). For example, let input array be arr = [10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]. Output should be 5 [index of 5 is 4].
