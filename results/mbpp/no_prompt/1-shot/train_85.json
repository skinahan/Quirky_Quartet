Also, write a recursive function to find the sum of all the elements of a list. The list may contain nested lists. You should not use any built-in functions or operators for this task. You may assume that there are no nested lists and each element is an integer. The input will be given as a list and you should return an integer output. Note that you are not allowed to import anything from python libraries or use any built-in functions/operators except isinstance(). If you wish to check if an element is an instance of some class, you can use isinstance() as follows: isinstance(element, class_name). For example, if we have x=2 then isinstance(x, int) returns True while isinstance(x, str) returns False. Also note that if we have y=[1,2] then y+y returns [1,2,1,2]. Here + operator performs concatenation on lists and not addition like it does for numbers (i.e., 2+3 = 5). So do not try to use + operator for this task even though it might seem very tempting! You must solve this problem using recursion only! Do not solve it using iteration! This problem has been taken from Hackerrank which has some restrictions on importing modules or using built-in functions/operators but since we want you to practice recursion here so we are allowing you to import module named math which contains some useful mathematical functions such as sqrt() (for finding square root) and pow() (for calculating power). But please do not use any other module or built-in functions/operators because these will distract your attention from practicing recursion which we want you to focus on in this assignment! Lastly note that your code should run in O(n) time where n is the number of elements present in input list including its nested sublists because otherwise it will be too slow for large inputs! Note that your code must run under 3 seconds because otherwise it will give TLE",
