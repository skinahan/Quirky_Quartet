You will be given the stock price for a given day and you have to find out the maximum profit you can earn from one transaction. You are allowed to complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). You must sell your stock before buying again. For example, if prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4], then you could buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), earning a profit of 6 - 1 = 5. Then buy on day 6 (price = 4) and sell on day 7 (price = 7), earning a profit of 7 - 4 = 3. Your function should return an integer which is the maximum profit that can be earned with this sequence of stock prices. If no profit can be made with these prices then return 0. Note: Prices are given in the form of an array where ith element denotes price on ith day in dollars. \rTask:\rWrite a python function to solve the above question.
