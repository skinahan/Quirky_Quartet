The Euclidean distance is given by the square root of ((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2). The function should return the computed value. Also write the pytest test cases to test the program. Note: Round off your answer upto 2 decimal places. Use math library for computing square root. For example if x1=5 and x2=10 then output should be 5.00. Refer to math library functions here. You can use pow() function in python to compute power of a number as pow(a, b) which gives value of a raised to power b i.e., a^b in mathematics terms (Refer this link). You can also refer this link for more details on rounding off numbers in python after performing computations with them. For example if you want to round off 3.1415 upto 2 decimal places then you can use round(3.1415, 2) which returns 3.14 as output i..e., it rounds off number upto 2 decimal places after decimal point and returns that value as output . If you want more details on how round() works then refer this link . Hint: You can use round() function inside your program where required after performing mathematical computations with numbers in python and get desired results accordingly instead of writing your own logic to do so!

Anagrams are the strings which have same characters but different order. For example, \"silent\" and \"listen\" are anagrams. If two strings have different characters then they cannot be anagrams. For example, \"one\" and \"two\" are not anagrams as they have different characters. If the length of both given strings is not equal then also they cannot be anagrams as they will contain different number of characters. If the length of both given strings is equal then we have to check whether all the characters in one string are present in other string and their frequency is also same or not. If all these conditions hold true, then we can say that two given strings are anagrams otherwise not. For example, if first string is \"tommarvoloriddle\" and second string is \"iamlordvoldemort\", then it should return True because both the strings have same number of 'a', 'm', 'l', 'o', 'r' etc., but if first string is \"geeksforgeeks\" and second string is \"forgeeksgeeks\", then it should return False because here, length of both given strings will be equal but all the characters in first string will not be present in second string (t will be missing). You may also assume that there won't be any space character in input strings. Lowercase and uppercase letters should be considered as same character (e.g., A and a should treated as same). Note: You can ignore any other character apart from alphabets in input strings like punctuation marks etc., Task: Write a python function to solve the above question using appropriate logic based on above explanations only (no additional comments or docstrings needed). Input Format: The first line contains one integer value n which represents number of test cases The next n lines contains two space separated lowercase/uppercase English alphabetical character sequences First line represents first sequence Second line represents second sequence Output Format: Print n lines where each line contains True/False based on corresponding test case result Answer: def check_anagram(str1, str2): if len(str1) != len(str2):",
