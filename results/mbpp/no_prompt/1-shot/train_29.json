The path should end at (m - 1, n - 1). You can move either right or down at any point in time. Your task is to complete the function possiblePaths(). Note that there may be more than one path between two points. Return only one of them and ignore all others. The returned array should have dimensions m x n where each element represents the number of possible paths between that cell and position (0, 0). If there is no possible path then return None for that cell in your answer matrix. For example if you are given 3 * 3 grid then your answer matrix should look like this [ [6 4 2] [4 2 1] [2 1 1] ] Here 6 indicates that there are 6 paths from cell (0, 0) to cell (0, 0). 4 indicates that there are 4 paths from cell (0 ,0) to cell(2 , 0). Similarly 2 indicates that there are two paths from cell(2 , 0) to cell(2 , 2).
