According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself). Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2 and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.

Answer: def check_perfect(num):\r\nsum = 0\r\nfor i in range(1 ,num ): \r\nif num % i == 0 : \r\nsum += i \r\nreturn True if sum==num else False\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Question: Write a python function which takes two integers A and B as input and returns true if one of them is 20 or their sum or difference or product is 20 otherwise returns false. For example f(20 , 10) will return true since 20-10 = 10 which equals 20 . Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer: def f1(a , b) : return True if (a == 20 or b == 20 or abs(a - b) == 20 or ((a * b) % 21) == 0 ) else False\n\n\n\n\n\n Question: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix (M rows & N columns) matrix at row rth column cth position then it's entire row & column set to zero For example consider below matrix Input Matrix : [[0 ,2] [3 ,4"
