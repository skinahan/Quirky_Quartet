Return True if string is palindrome, else return False. Do not use any inbuilt methods/functions to check for palindrome. Also you are not allowed to use any built-in functions or methods. Note that the string can contain whitespace characters which should be ignored while checking for palindrome. For example \"I went on no sleep\" is a valid palindrome even though there are spaces in between the characters. You need to write your own logic for this question. Hint: Use two pointers (one at the start and one at the end of the string) and move them towards each other ignoring non-alphanumeric characters and checking whether the alphanumeric character at those pointers are equal or not till they cross each other (or become equal). In case you are stuck with this question, refer this link \u2013 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-to-check-if-a-singly-linked-list-is-palindrome/. You can use only head of linked list as parameter to your function as rest of linked list will be accessible using head only (because it\u2019s a singly linked list). Note: You have already studied about singly linked lists in class so if you feel like revising it then refer https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/linked_list_algorithms.htm . Also note that here we need to consider alphanumeric characters only while checking for palindromes whereas in above link all characters including special symbols are considered while checking for palindromes from a given linked list (but here we don\u2019t need to consider special symbols).
