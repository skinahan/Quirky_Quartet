The function should ignore case sensitivity and should not use any built-in functions except for the ones used in the sample code provided below. You can assume that the strings will contain only alphabets. You can also assume that both strings will be non-empty. Your program should run in O(n+m) time complexity where n is the length of str1 and m is the length of str2. The function signature is given below: def count_occurrences(str1, str2): # your code here # return count, where count is an integer value indicating number of occurrences of str2 in str1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask: Write a python function to solve the above question.

A positive integer is called a power of two if it is equal to 2^n for some n, where n is an integer greater than or equal to 0. For example, 64 is a power of two because it equals 2^6, but -64 is not because it does not equal 2^6. The given number can be negative and can have any number of digits. You do not need to handle exceptional inputs such as 0, 1 etc. You just need to implement the given function and return either True or False depending on the input being a power of two or not respectively. Assume that you are only given numbers (positive or negative). You cannot use any library functions like pow(). Also you cannot use any loops (for/while etc.). You can implement this by using recursion though! If you are confused about recursion then refer here for more details on recursion: https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/recursive/.
