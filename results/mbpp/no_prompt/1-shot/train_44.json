For example, if the input is [1, 2, 4], then output should be 3. If the input is [3, 7, 5, 9], then output should be 6. If the input is [2], then output should be 1. If there are multiple missing numbers in an array of size n+m-1, then print all of them separated by space. Assume that elements of array are from 1 to n and one element is missing from this series. For example if arr[] = {4, 8} and n=10 then output should be \u201c1 2 3 5 6 7 9 10\u201d (without quotes). Note that there may be more than one missing number in arr[]. The above algorithm will take O(n) time and O(n) extra space if we use hashing or sorting techniques but it can also be solved in O(n) time and O(1) extra space using Gauss Formula for sum of arithmetic progression which states that sum of first n natural numbers is n*(n+1)/2. We can use this formula to find out sum of all elements present in arr[] and subtract it from expected sum which will give us remaining element as result.
