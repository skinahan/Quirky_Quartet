Use the reduce() function to solve the problem. Note: Do not use built-in functions min() and max(). Also, do not use sort() method. Assume that all elements in the list are comparable. Write your own logic to find the maximum and minimum numbers. Return both values (maximum and minimum). You can store them in a tuple also if you wish so. The reduce() function is imported from functools module of python library by default for this question, so you need not import it explicitly. You can write helper functions as needed for your solution but do not change the name of the main function or its input parameters and return type if specified otherwise your submission will fail test cases automatically during evaluation of your code on our platform. Also note that no additional imports are allowed other than what has already been provided by default for this question, so you need not import anything else explicitly to solve this question, but still make sure that standard libraries are imported as required by python language specification (e.g., math module for mathematical operations). Your code must run successfully on our online evaluation system when submitted using submit button provided below on this page, failing which it will be marked as incorrect answer automatically during evaluation of your code on our platform and hence you will get zero marks for this question even if your output is correct when tested locally using sample test cases provided below on this page or any other arbitrary test cases generated by yourself locally using Python interpreter/compiler/IDE installed locally on your machine or any online Python interpreter/compiler/IDE available freely online like https://www.onlinegdb.com/. Please note that we have disabled printing anything to standard output stream from within helper functions or main function defined for solving this problem statement; hence all debugging messages must be printed to standard error stream only using print >> sys.stderr statement syntax as used here; otherwise it may lead to wrong answers due to buffering issues on our evaluation system while running your code remotely after submission using submit button provided below on this page without any further warning message issued beforehand about such issues with respect to incorrect answers due to",
