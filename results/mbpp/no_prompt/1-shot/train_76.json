You can either climb 1 or 2 steps at a time. For example, if n = 4 then there are 5 ways to reach 4'th stair from the bottom. The ways are {1 1 1 1}, {1 2 1}, {2 2}, {1 1 2} and {2 1 1}. So output should be 5. If n = 3 then output should be 3 i.e. {1 1 1}, {1 2} and {2 1}. You can only climb either one step or two steps at a time. You cannot jump over two steps at a time, for example you cannot jump from 0'th stair to 3'th stair in one go (you have to land on first or second step in between). Task: Write a python function which takes input as an integer 'n' and returns the number of ways as an integer value by solving the above question using recursion technique.

If the number is not perfect square then return floor value of the square root. For example if input is 36 then output should be 6 and if input is 35 then output should be 5. Do not use any library functions. You can assume that input will always be positive integer. You can write additional helper functions to solve this problem, but don't use any built-in library functions like sqrt(). Also you can't use floating point numbers in your solution which means that your solution should only contain integers and no decimal points anywhere in it. Do not import any packages from pypi or built-in modules from python standard library for this task. The purpose of this task is to check your understanding of basic programming constructs like loops, conditionals and variables so don't use any advanced features like list comprehensions etc for solving this problem. Only use simple for loops in your solution and try to implement it without using any special features from python language except those which we have covered in our lectures/tutorials so far i.e., only use basic python features like variables, for loop, conditional statements etc to solve this problem instead of using advanced features like list comprehension etc because we haven't covered list comprehensions yet in our tutorials/lectures so far but feel free to use them after we cover them later on during the course because they are very useful feature from python programming language and make code more concise but don't worry about them right now as they are not required at all for solving this problem without using them so just focus on writing simple code without using anything fancy/advanced at all i.e., just stick with basics! Also please note that you are allowed to write additional helper functions as needed but you can't change the signature of given function because graders will call your function with above mentioned signature only i.e., def sqrt(n). Your code will be tested against multiple test cases so make sure that you have written generic code which works correctly for all possible inputs instead of hard-coding things here and there! Also note that we have already provided some test cases in mock_data folder which contains json",
