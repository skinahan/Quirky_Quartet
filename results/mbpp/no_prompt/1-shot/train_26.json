Return the length of such longest subsequence. If more than one subsequences are found with same length, return the one with minimum starting index. If no such subsequences exist, return 0. For example, for an input sequence [5, 6, 3, 5, 7], you need to return 4 as [3, 5, 7] is the longest sorted sub-sequence and it starts from index 2. You can assume that there will be only one unique solution for each test case and you don't need to worry about time complexity of your solution as we have mentioned in our instructions that time complexity is not a concern for this question. For example: Input Sequence : [5 ,6 ,3 ,4 ,1] Output : 3 Explanation : The Longest Subsequence which is sorted is [3 ,4 ,1] and its length is 3 Input Sequence : [2 ,4 ] Output : 2 Explanation : The Longest Subsequence which is sorted is [2 ,4 ] and its length is 2 Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.
