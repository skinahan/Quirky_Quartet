For example, number 9 has binary representation 1001 and contains a binary gap of length 2. The number 529 has binary representation 1000010001 and contains two binary gaps: one of length 4 and one of length 3.

Write a python function to find the longest sequence of consecutive zeros in an integer's decimal value which is surrounded by ones in its decimal value's bits form i.e., in its corresponding bit form (binary form). You have to consider only positive integers as input arguments for this problem statement i..e., you should not consider negative numbers as input arguments for this problem statement . For example, if the input argument is 9 then it's corresponding bit form (binary form) is 1001 where you can see that there are two sequences with consecutive zeros which are surrounded by ones at both ends but out of these two sequences with consecutive zeros, you have to consider only the longest sequence which happens to be second one i..e., sequence with four consecutive zeros as output for this problem statement . Similarly if the input argument is 15 then it's corresponding bit form (binary form) is 1111 so here there are no sequences with consecutive zeros which are surrounded by ones at both ends so output for this case should be 0 .
