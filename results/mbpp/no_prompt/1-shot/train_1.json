If there are more than one such substring return the first one. Else return \"None\". Ignore case while comparing characters. Assume that the string consists of only alphabets (a-z and A-Z). The input string may contain spaces also. The input string length will not exceed 1000 characters. You can use built-in functions and data structures in your solution. For example, if given string is \"abcbbbbcccbdddadacb\", then the output should be \"bcbbbbcccb\". If more than one answer exists then print any of them. If no such substring exists then print None. Do not consider empty substrings as an answer if k = 1 e.g., for string \"abcd\", k = 1, then do not consider \"\" as an answer even though it is a valid substring with unique characters but it is not a continuous substring like \"bcd\" or \"cde\" etc., so your function should print None in this case.'''Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.'''No additional comments and docstrings are needed.'''Answer: def longest_substring_with_k_distinct(str1, k): n = len(str1) # Initialize result current_count = 0 max_count = 0 max_char = 0 curr_start = 0 max_start = 0 max_end = 0 visited= [0]*MAXCHAR # Consider all substrings beginning # with str[i] for i in range(n): max_end += 1 visited[ord(str1[i]) - ord('a')] += 1 # If this is first occurrence, # increment distinct count if (visited[ord(str1[i]) - ord('a')] == 1 ): currentCount += 1 # Update result if we get more matches while (maxEnd < n and currentCount <= k ): maxEnd += 1 visited[ord(str1[maxEnd",

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward. For example, madam or nurses run. A string will be considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards ignoring spaces and punctuation. Also, an empty string is considered as valid palindrome. If more than one longest palindromes are found, return them all in any order. If no palindromes are found, return None/null/nil/\"\" (depending on the language of your choice). Please note that you should only consider alphanumeric characters when determining whether or not two strings are anagrams of each other (a-z and 0-9). You can assume that all input strings will only contain lowercase letters and numbers only. However, you can also handle upper case letters by converting them to lower case letters before checking for anagrams. The following characters are not considered part of an alphanumeric character set: [ ] ( ) { } \" ' ! @ # $ % ^ & * - + = | \\ / ? . > , < ~ ` : ; _ . Note that space (' ') is not part of this list although it is whitespace character which separates words on a page; it should be treated like other characters and NOT ignored when determining whether or not two strings are anagrams of each other (you may choose to ignore this detail if you wish). For example: \"A man, a plan, a canal Panama!\" is NOT equivalent to \"A man,a plan ,acanal panama\". Task Write python function to solve the above question.

If there are no characters which are non-repeated, return -1.  Note: Consider alphabets only (a-z). Ignore numbers, symbols and whitespaces.  For example for the input \"abcaba\", the output is \"c\" and for input \"ababcbacadefegdehijhklij\", the output is \"i\". Note: The words are case sensitive. For example, an input of \"ABCc\" should return -1 as 'c' is already repeated. Also, consider letter combinations such as 'aa', 'bb', etc as repeating characters and not as a single character. In such cases, output will also be -1.  For example, an input of \"abcabc\" should return -1 because each alphabet appears more than once in it.   Also if all characters are repeating then consider the first character to be non-repeating one like for input \"aaaaaaaaaa\", output will be 'a'.   If there is only one character in a string then that itself would be considered as first non-repeating character like for input \"z\" or any other single length string, output will also be 'z'.    If no characters repeat at all then return -2 like for inputs like \"-@#$%^&*()_+=-{}[]|\\':;?/>.<,\" or any other combination of symbols and special characters or numbers which do not repeat at all, then output would be \"-2\".   In case of empty strings \"\" or '' (blank strings), return value should also be \"-2\".     Use only lowercase letters from English alphabets (from a to z) only as inputs otherwise your program might fail during automated evaluation on our end due to TypeError exception caused by invalid type conversion from str to int during comparison with expected answer key values generated by us on our end.    For example if you use uppercase letters such as A instead of lowercase letter such as a while defining your function parameters or variables inside it then it may cause TypeError exception while comparing your program's results with expected answer key values",
