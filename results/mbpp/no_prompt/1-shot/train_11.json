Return True if it is palindrome, else return False. Note: Ignore whitespaces, and consider only alphanumeric characters for checking the string. For example, \"Red rum, sir, is murder\" is a palindrome when considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring whitespaces. Similarly \"Never odd or even\" is also considered as a palindrome here. Do not use any in-built functions/libraries for your main logic. You can write additional functions as per requirement for code modularity but your main logic should be written without using any library/in-built function (except the in-built function enumerate() which can be used to iterate over lists).
