The array is sorted and distinct. The function should return -1 if no such element exists. Consider 0-based indexing for this problem. For example, if the given array is [1, 2, 3, 4], then the fourth smallest element is 3 and hence your function should return 3 when k=3 (0-based indexing). If there is no such element as fourth smallest then your function should return -1. Note that you are not allowed to modify the input array and you are expected to solve this problem using recursion only (no iteration). You can assume that there will be at most 1000 elements in the input array and at most 2000 recursive calls will be made per test case. If you exceed these limits without any other error in code or logic then your solution will be marked as wrong answer even if it gives correct output for some inputs within these limits. Your score for each test case will be 100% if all recursive calls made by your function do not exceed these limits and also your code does not have any syntax or logical errors (including runtime errors). You may lose up to 20% marks based on number of recursive calls made by your code beyond these limits or due to syntax or logical errors present in your code (even if it gives correct output for some inputs within these limits). Your total score for a question will be average of scores obtained over all test cases where each score will be calculated as explained above with respect to individual test case i.e., 100% * [number of successful test cases] / [total number of test cases]. If you do not solve any test case successfully then total score for that question would become 0%. In order to avoid confusion about how scores are calculated across different questions, we have added an additional line containing \"Score\" after output produced by sample tests and also clarified scoring method above each question on this page before submission deadline was reached so that students could make informed decisions about which questions they choose to attempt during contest period itself instead of waiting",

Return true if prime else false. If the input is not an integer, return None. A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors, whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory: any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering. This theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime; an informal argument for this involves noting that any number with more than two factors fails to be prime but one with two factors (1 and itself) passes this test by vacuity (since there are no others). Therefore, every natural number greater than one can be written as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering; moreover, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes that this representation is useful for doing arithmetic among such numbers.
