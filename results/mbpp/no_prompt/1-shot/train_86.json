Also write the test cases for this function. The test cases should cover all types of input values (like 0, 1, -ve values etc.) and must raise appropriate exceptions. Assume that the input is always integer type and output is always an integer type. For example if user inputs 'a' or '2.5', it should raise an exception saying \"Please enter only integers\". If user passes zero as any of the input value it should raise an exception saying \"Zero is not allowed as input\". If user passes negative number as any of the input value it should raise an exception saying \"Negative number not allowed as input\". You can use python built-in module unittest to write test cases for your code. For more details refer https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html . You can also use pytest module instead of unittest to write unit tests for your code but you need to install pytest module before using it in your program by pip install pytest command in terminal or command prompt window (refer https://pypi.org/project/pytest/ ). Use assertEqual method from unittest or assert from pytest modules to check if expected output matches with actual output produced by your code and report failure if they don't match else report success for that particular test case execution with appropriate messages like expected output does not match with actual output etc., You can also use assertTrue method from unittest or assert from pytest modules to check if expected result is True else report failure for that particular test case execution with appropriate message like expected result is True but got False etc., Note: Do not use print statements in your code except when printing the final answer because print statements will be used by grader program only to read final answer produced by your code and compare it against correct answer provided by grader program so print statements used anywhere else will cause errors while grading since they are not present in grader program's standard output stream which will be used by grader program only to read final answer produced by your code and compare it against correct answer provided by grader program so",

You can only use the following arithmetic operators in your solution: +, - and *. You can only use loops to iterate over the range of numbers. If you have doubts on what is allowed and not allowed please see the question guidelines. Do not use any built-in functions like pow() etc. For example, 2 is prime and 6 is not prime because 6 = 2 * 3 . 0 and 1 are not considered as prime numbers. Negative numbers are also not considered as primes. If you have any doubts about the question please comment below in the comments section below so that we can help you out with any questions that you might have. Your solution will be evaluated based on how many test cases it passes for different ranges of inputs (see constraints). If your solution fails for some test cases then your score will be zero for that particular test case. Please read the question guidelines carefully before submitting your solution to avoid unnecessary problems with your submission.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. This constraint will be checked by our graders programmatically so no need to write it in comments or docstring explicitly as shown below in sample code snippet (comments which start with # symbol will be ignored by our graders). The name of your function should be my_prime_test . Please don't change this name otherwise you'll get an error message from our grader system while submitting your code for evaluation! Also make sure that there should'nt be any syntax errors in your submission otherwise it won't pass all test cases! Please note that passing all test cases doesn't mean full marks! You need to follow all instructions carefully mentioned in this problem statement including constraints section! You'll get full marks only when you follow all instructions mentioned here carefully! If you're still facing issues after reading this problem statement then take help from online resources like youtube videos etc or ask someone who has better knowledge than you do! Try solving this problem first yourself before going through other resources online! Good luck :)!!! Keep coding :D!!! Happy coding :D!!! Have fun :)!!! Solve more problems :D!!!

The function takes variable number of arguments and returns the average. You can assume all arguments are integers. The function should return -1 for invalid input. For example if the number of arguments passed is 0 or any argument is not an integer then the function should return -1. Also if any of the number is negative then it should return -1. Assume all arguments are given as positive integers and there will be no trailing or leading spaces in any argument and there will be no extra spaces between two numbers in the argument list. Note that you need to write a recursive function to solve this problem. Do not worry about maximum limit on recursion depth in python, you can assume that it won\u2019t exceed 500 times (including 500).\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Your code must pass all test cases given below: Note: You can use sys module for handling command line arguments but do not use any other module than sys or math without confirming with us first (we will let you know if you can use other modules). Also note that your code must run on Python 3 only (it will be tested using Python 3) and not on Python 2 or lower versions of Python 3 because we have disabled support for Python 2 for this problem due to security issues with it\u2019s cPickle module which has been used by us for testing your code against multiple test cases due to which we cannot upgrade cPickle version used by us from old versions which were vulnerable to security attacks like arbitrary code execution exploits etc.. So please make sure that your code runs on Python 3 only otherwise it might fail some test cases even though it may work fine locally when tested against sample test cases provided along with question statement (as sample test cases are also tested using cPickle). We apologize for inconvenience caused because of this but we had no choice as we cannot upgrade our system now due to some technical reasons related to maintenance cost etc.. We hope you understand our situation and cooperate with us so that everyone gets fair chance at solving problems without having unfair advantage over others who have worked hard on their solutions while following rules strictly while others might have exploited",
