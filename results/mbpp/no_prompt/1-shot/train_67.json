For example, if the given string is \"forgeeksskeegfor\", the output should be \"geeksskeeg\". If there are more than one palindromes with same length then print any one of them. The input string may contain spaces or special characters. In such cases consider only alphabets as characters and ignore spaces and other special characters. For example, if the given string is \u201cI love racecars that go fast\u201d then your program should print \u201cracecar\u201d as output. If input string does not have any palindrome then print \"-1\" (without quotes). It is also possible that a single character can be considered as longest palindrome in some cases which will also be considered as correct answer for this question. Your program must run in O(n2) time where n is length of input string. You need not worry about memory constraints for this question. Your algorithm need not be case sensitive i.e., an input like \"I LOVE RACECARS THAT GO FAST\" should also be accepted and give same output as above mentioned test case does (i.e., \u201cracecar\u201d). You don't have to worry about punctuations either i.e., an input like \"I love racecars that go fast!\" should also give you same output as above mentioned test case does (i.e., \u201cracecar\u201d). Note that you don't have to remove punctuations or change the case of letters etc; just consider only alphabets while solving this problem and ignore all other characters such as spaces or punctuations etc; Your algorithm must run in O(n2) time where n is length of input string which may contain spaces and special characters too but you need to consider only alphabets while solving this problem ignoring all other characters such as spaces or punctuations etc; You are free to use built-in function/methods provided by python standard library but you cannot use",

Numbers can be 0 or negative. For example, [2, 4, 6, 2, 5] should return 13, since we pick 2, 6 and 5. [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10 since we pick 5 and 5. Follow up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space? \nTask: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. \r Answer:\r def maxSumNonAdjacent(nums):\r if len(nums) == 0:\r return 0\r incl = nums[0]\r excl = 0\r for i in range(1 , len(nums)):\r inclNew = excl + nums[i]   # Inclusion means including the current element in the result set and exclusion means excluding the current element from the result set so we have two variables to store these values for each iteration one for inclusion other for exclusion . So at each step we have to decide whether to include or exclude that element so what will be our criteria ? We know that at each step we have two options either include or exclude so which one will give us maximum value ? The answer is simple whichever gives us maximum value at that step we'll go with it . So how can we calculate this ? Let's say there are two variables named inclNew and exclNew where inclNew stores max sum including current element & exclNew stores max sum excluding current element . Now what will be their values ? If we include current element then it means previously excluded elements will now be included (as now they are not adjacent ) , so max sum including current element will be previous excluded + current element (excl + nums[i]) . And if we exclude then it means previous included elements are still included so max sum excluding current element will be previous included (incl). Now which one is greater either inclusion or exclusion ? Whichever is greater that's our answer , simple right ! So let's implement this logic :-\n\n exclNew = max(incl , excl) # Here I",
