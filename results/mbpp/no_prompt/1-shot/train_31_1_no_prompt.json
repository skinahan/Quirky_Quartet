Do not use any built-in function or method to accomplish this task.

You can only use indexing, slicing and looping constructs available in Python to solve this problem.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. You can only use indexing, slicing and looping constructs available in Python to solve this problem. Do not include any other statements or string literals such as \"print\" etc., in your answer. Use of these extra statements will lead to deduction of points/failure of test cases leading to failure of your submission entirely (zero marks). The number of test cases run on our end may be more than what is shown on the platform, so do not make assumptions about the test cases based on what is shown on platform (use random input data instead). The number of test cases run on our end may also be different from what is shown on platform when you submit your answer first time; however, it will always remain constant after that so you can safely assume that it won't change once you have submitted your answer first time successfully (no error messages are thrown by our evaluator). If we find that you have hard coded some values into your code then it will lead to severe deduction of points/failure of test cases leading to failure of your submission entirely (zero marks). Your code must work with all kinds of valid inputs (like lists containing numbers, strings etc.). If we find that you have hard coded some values into your code then it will lead to severe deduction or complete loss of marks leading to failure of your submission entirely (zero marks).
