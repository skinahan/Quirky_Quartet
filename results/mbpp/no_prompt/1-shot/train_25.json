The sides of the triangle should be parallel to the axis of x and y. The side length is given by a positive integer value. If no such triangle exists then return 0 as output. Assume that there will be only one such triangle with largest area. The function should return an integer value corresponding to the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in a semicircle with side length equal to a positive integer value n. If no such triangle exists then return 0 as output. Assume that there will be only one such triangle with largest area. Note: Area is measured in square units and n is measured in units corresponding to side length of semicircle and also for sides of triangles which are parallel to axis x and y respectively . For example if n = 2 then unit for measuring sides is same as unit for measuring radius which means radius = 2 units and diameter = 4 units . Also note that 1/2 * pi * r^2 gives you semicircle's area where r is radius . So for n=2 , area of semicircle will be 2 * pi squnits . For more clarification look at testcases below .\nTask:\nWrite a python function def max_triangle_area_semicircle(n).

The length of the rectangle is twice its width. You can assume that the radius is at least 3 units. The function should return the area of the rectangle and its location in the form of a tuple with two elements, x and y, where x is the distance from left edge of semicircle to center of rectangle and y is distance from bottom edge to center of rectangle. If there are multiple such rectangles, then return any one among them.
