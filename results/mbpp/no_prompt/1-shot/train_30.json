The length of the list can be less than or equal to 2. If there are no elements in the given list, return -2147483648 which is the smallest possible integer value. If there is only one element, return -2147483647 which is the second smallest possible integer value. The function should not modify the original list and should consider only non-duplicate elements in the given list while finding out the second largest number. For example, if given list is [12, 35, 1, 10], then your function should return 35 as output and if input list is [1], then your function should return -2147483647 as output. Note that we have used -2147473648 and -2147473647 as smallest possible integer values for this question because python does not support MIN_VALUE for integers like java does (Integer.MIN_VALUE). Also note that your function should not raise any exception for any kind of invalid inputs (like null pointer exception etc.) instead it should gracefully ignore them and return appropriate values whenever applicable as mentioned above in this problem statement itself. You can assume that all inputs will be valid lists with at least one non-duplicate element in them but you need to handle all other corner cases appropriately without failing abruptly or raising exceptions unnecessarily (you can choose to raise exceptions if you are comfortable with it but make sure they are handled gracefully where ever applicable). You can use builtin functions/methods but don't use any library method/function which directly gives solution for this problem otherwise you will get zero marks for this question (because we want you to practice how to solve these kinds of problems yourself without relying on library methods/functions). Also note that doing so will result in zero marks even if you have written some other logic correctly because we want you to practice how to solve these kinds of problems yourself without relying on library methods/functions). Also note that doing so will result in zero marks even if you have written some other logic correctly because we want you to solve these kinds of problems by writing code from scratch using basic programming constructs like loops and",
