The same repeated number may be chosen from candidates unlimited number of times. Each pair must be unique and different from other pairs. For example, given candidate set 2,3,6,7 and target 7, A solution set is: [2, 2, 3] and [7]. The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations. For example: If input is nums = [1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5], target = 8 then output should be 4 as there are four combination (1 + 7), (2 + 6), (3 + 5), (4 + 4). Note that you can use same element only once but you can use it multiple times in your answer as shown above. It should also be different from other combination like if two elements are same say 1 + 1 then it should not count as two combinations rather it should count as one combination only once. So the output for above example would still remain 4 only and not 5 because 1 + 1 counts as one combination only once. You may assume that all numbers are positive integers with no duplicates inside the given list of numbers except zero which may appear any number of times inside the given list of numbers but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to include zero inside your final solution set because they are not positive integers rather they are just zeros so they don\u2019t add anything to your final sum result so don\u2019t include them in your final answer or else you will get wrong answer for test cases having zeros inside their input lists like nums = [1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5], target = 8 where your answer would be 5 instead of 4 if you mistakenly consider zero also as one valid element or number inside your input list which is completely wrong because zero is neither a positive integer nor an element or a number so don\u2019t consider them at all when solving this problem otherwise you will get wrong results for some test cases having zeros inside their input lists like nums=[0], target=0 where expected output is 0 but if",

Extract the expression including: a string of length > 1 starting with a letter or _ and ending with a number (can be more than one digit). The number defines the end of the expression. Print out every expression and its length. The input is given as a string containing different characters and numbers, e.g., abc5defgh6ijk7lmn8opq9rst10uvwxyz11012. In this case, your output should be abc5 5; defgh6 6; ijk7 7; lmn8 8; opq9 9; rst10 10; uvwxyz11011 11011. Note that you should not print out empty expressions (e.g., rst10uvwxyz11011). Note that you can use regular expressions to solve this task easily! However, try to figure out how to solve it without using regular expressions! You can assume that there will be no empty strings in the input (i.e., all strings will contain at least one character). You can also assume that all expressions will be separated by at least one space character from other expressions or other non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., abc5 defgh6 ijk7).
