The function should return an integer value representing maximum sum for sublist of size k for given list nums and k as input parameters. If there is no sublist present then it should return -1 as output parameter. Note that if two or more sums are equal then it should return first sum found in list nums . For example, if nums = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8 ,7] and k = 3 then it should return 19 as output parameter because 10 + 5 + 2 is first sublist present in nums which has maximum sum 19 for sublist of size 3 and also this is largest among all other sums which are equal to 19 like 7 + 8 + 4 or 8 + 7 + 4 etc... but it should not consider such sums because they are after first occurrence which has maximum sum 19 in list nums . Similarly if nums = [10, 5, 2, 7 ,8 ,7] and k = 4 then it should also return 19 because 10 + 5 + 2+7 is only one possible sublist present in list nums . Also if there is no possible combination available for given value k then it should also consider -1 as output parameter like if nums = [2 ,3] and k=4 then output will be -1 . Also note that you need to write complete code with required logic inside one single python function only without any external imports",

The list of words can be assumed to be a dictionary. The input parameters to the function are word1 and word2. You may assume that word1 and word2 are different and both exist in dictionary. You may assume that each entry in the dictionary contains only one word. The output should be a number denoting the minimum distance between two words or -1 if there is no such distance possible (i.e., they don\u2019t exist together). Note that you can traverse up, down, left and right from a given cell (i, j) provided the new coordinates remain within the boundary of matrix MxN where M is number of rows and N is number of columns respectively. You cannot move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed). For example consider below matrix as reference where each cell represents an integer value which denotes its position relative to other cells with respect to row and column index values respectively: [[0 0 0 0] [0 1 2 3] [0 4 5 6] [0 7 8 9]] Now consider two words \u201c7\u201d and \u201c9\u201d which exists at index positions (3, 1) and (3, 3) respectively as shown below where each cell represents an integer value which denotes its position relative to other cells with respect to row and column index values respectively: [[7 7 7 7] [7 1 2 3] [7 4 5 6] [7 9 9 9]] The minimum distance between these two words would be 2 because we need exactly two steps from one cell to another e.g., we start from \u201c7\u201d at index position (3, 1) then we need one step rightwards i.e., traverse to index position (3, 2) then one step downwards i.e., traverse to index position (4, 2), now we have reached \u201c9",
