No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\n\n \nQuestion:\nWrite a function to find all pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number. The input array must not contain duplicate elements. The order of the elements in the input array should be preserved as output. Assume that, we have only one solution for a given input set and also assume that, output should contain unique pairs only (i.e., if there are two possible pairs (a, b) and (b, a) then either of them would be considered). For example, if input set is [3, 5, 7] and given sum is 10 then output should contain only one pair i.e., [5, 5]. If there is no possible pair then output should be empty list i.e., [] . Note: In case of unsorted arrays or arrays with duplicate elements you need to sort them first before applying this algorithm so that your solution will work for all test cases including those cases where input set has duplicate elements or not sorted already as shown in this example- [3, 5, 6] & given sum = 11 --> [[3, 8], [5 ,6]] but your solution will work even if input set contains duplicate elements or not sorted already i.e., [3 ,5 ,8] & given sum = 11 --> [[3 ,8]] . But make sure that your code works correctly when input set has no duplicates and already sorted too i.e., [1 ,2 ,4 ] & given sum = 5 --> [[1 ,4]] . You are allowed to use built-in functions like sort() etc for sorting purpose only but you cannot use built-in functions like index(), count() etc which can solve this problem by itself else it will not be counted as your submission because using these built-in functions means you have solved this problem by yourself which is against our policy because we need you to write complete code on your own without using any built-in functions which can directly solve this problem by itself else it will not be counted as your submission because using these built-in functions means you have solved this",
