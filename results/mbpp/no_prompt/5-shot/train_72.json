The following figure shows how a 3 x 4 board can be filled with 2 x 1 dominoes. There are 5 ways to fill this board. If we fix the first cell in a row, there are only two choices for filling the remaining cells in that row. If we fix the first cell as Black, there are 4 ways of filling remaining cells and if we fix it as White, there are also 4 ways of filling remaining cells. So total number of configurations = 5 + 5 = 10. But these configurations are not distinct because rotation and reflection operations can generate same configuration from other configuration. So if we take only distinct configurations into account, then there will be only 5 distinct configurations which is equal to number of tilings using 1 x 2 tiles (shown in below figure). We can easily verify that all those five tilings can be generated by rotation and reflection operations on any one tiling shown below.

A perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors. The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2 and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: (1 + 2 + 3 + 6) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128. Write a python function to identify whether a given positive number is a perfect number or not. Also write the pytest test cases to test the program. Note: Ignore checking for negative integers as input values for this question. Also assume that any non-integer value passed as input will result in an error message \"Invalid Input\" being displayed and None being returned from your function. For example if -1 or \"abc\" are passed as inputs then your function should display an error message \"Invalid Input\" and return None instead of raising any exception or error condition such as ZeroDivisionError etc., Sample Input\tExpected Output\tExplaination\tTestcase1\t[6]\tTrue Perfect Number Testcase2\t[28]\tTrue Perfect Number Testcase3\t[496]\tTrue Perfect Number Testcase4\t[8128] True Perfect Number Testcase5 [5] False Not a Perfect Number Testcase6 [-1] Invalid Input None \nTask: Write a python function to solve the above question with following constraints: No additional comments and docstrings are needed Do not use any inbuilt functions like sum(), divmod() etc., Do not import any additional modules like math, fractions etc., Do not use any other functions or methods except those explicitly mentioned above Assume that any non-integer value passed as input will result in an error message \"Invalid Input\" being displayed and None being returned from your function Answer: def check_perfect_number(n): if type(n) == int: if n > 0 : s = 0 for i in range(1, n // 2+1): if n % i",
