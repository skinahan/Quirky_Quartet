If there are more than two largest numbers, then return the second largest number. If there are no second largest numbers, then return -1. Sort and pop operations are not allowed. Only traversal of the list is allowed. You can use only one loop and O(n) time complexity is expected. You can assume that all elements in the list will be greater than -10000000000 and less than 1000000000000. Do not modify the contents of the list or use any extra data structure like array, dictionary etc., which will take extra space and/or time complexity to solve this problem. For example, if you want to store k maximum elements seen so far during your traversal, it would take O(k) extra space which is not allowed by this problem statement because you have been asked to solve this problem with O(n) time complexity and O(1) extra space complexity only.*   Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.

Return the sum of all digits present in the string. If no digit is present in that string return -1. If multiple instances of a digit are present, count all instances of that digit. Ignore floating point numbers and strings having float numbers as input. Return -2 for such cases. For example, if input is \"abc123dd34\", it should return 12 (1+2+3+4). If input is \"abcdef\", it should return -1 and if input is \"abc12dd34ef56\" it should return 18 (all digits present). Note that this problem deals with integers only and not floating point numbers or double values. Also note that we are considering only positive integers as input and not negative values or zero (\"-123\", \"0\" etc.). Ignore these inputs and just return -2 for them as they can't be added up to form a sum anyway (because they don't have any positive digits). If there are no non-digit characters in the string, consider the whole string as one single integer value and find its sum (e.g., if input is \"1234\" then output will be 10 which is 1+2+3+4). For example, for an input of \u201cabcd12efg68hijklm9\u201d, it should output 39 (12 + 9 + 6 + 8). It should also handle decimal points correctly (e.g., for an input \u201cabcd12efg68hijklm9\u201d, output should be 39 instead of 3 because we ignore decimal points here). For an invalid number like \u201cabcd12efg68hijk$%#lm9\u201d, you can either throw an error or just report it as invalid number by returning -2 as output (your choice!). You may assume that there will be at most one \"$\" sign or one \"%\" sign or one \"#\" sign in any given valid number but there could be multiple decimal points in any valid",
