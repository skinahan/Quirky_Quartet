If the element is not found, return -1. Do not use any built-in functions. Use exceptions to handle exceptional cases like type error or value error. And handle them accordingly. Also raise your own exceptions wherever necessary to distinguish between types of errors and handle them separately. Ensure that all exceptions are handled properly and submit just the function along with appropriate comments, docstrings and test cases to test your code thoroughly. Assume that input list will always contain integers only and it need not be sorted in any order. Also ensure that input list does not contain any duplicate elements (refer sample I/O). Also write detailed comments for every piece of code you write as part of your solution explaining its purpose clearly using appropriate examples wherever necessary (you can refer this link for more details on writing comments). You can use online PEP8 checker to check whether your Python code is compliant with PYTHON STYLE GUIDELINES (PEP8). You can also refer this link for more details on writing docstrings and this link for a quick reference of Python built-in exceptions . However, ensure that you use only exception handling techniques discussed in class to solve this problem as it is being evaluated based on those concepts taught till now. Note: Do not add any additional functions other than what has been provided here, do not import additional modules or packages other than what has been provided here, do not change the signature of the given function(s), do not change the name(s) of already given variables/constants/functions etc., do read all instructions carefully before starting off with coding and finally submit just one single file (.py) containing only one function which needs to be written as part of this problem statement as your final submission file (along with appropriate comments, docstrings etc.). You may assume that Python version 3 is being used here along with IDLE or PyCharm CE IDE as discussed in class while solving these problems unless mentioned otherwise explicitly below each question statement below.
