You can use as many coins of given denominations as you want. Assume that you have infinite supply of coins. The change making problem exhibits optiaml substructure property in the following manner. Suppose we know the number of ways to make change for N using 1, 2 and 5 denominations. We can use this information to determine the number of ways to make change for N+1 using 1, 2 and 5 denominations as follows: Number of ways to make change for N+1 using 1, 2 and 5 = Number of ways to make change for N using 1, 2 and 5 (we get this by choosing not to include 1 in changes) + Number of ways to make change for (N+1-1) using 1, 2 and 5 (we get this by choosing one 1 denomination) + Number of ways to make change for (N+1-2) using 1, 2 and 5 (we get this by choosing one 2 denomination) + Number of ways to make change for (N+1-5) using 1, 2 and 5 (we get this by choosing one 5 denomination). Note that we need not consider more than one coin from any denomination since we have infinite supply available. Also note that if we are considering a coin value V then we should only consider values greater than V since we want the minimum number possible total number coins in making changes. Task: Write a python function which accepts two parameters - An integer amount representing the amount whose minimum number possible total number coins are needed in making changes A list denoting different coin denominations available Write a python function which returns - An integer denoting minimum possible total number coins required in making changes Answer: def countWaysToMakeChange(denominations, value): n = len(denominations) dp = [0] * (value + 1); dp[0] = 0; # Base case # Iterate through all denominations for i in range(n): # Iterate through all values upto value j jj",
