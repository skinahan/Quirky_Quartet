You can assume that all the given numbers are unique in a list. Do not use built-in functions to solve this question.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Hint: Use sort() method of lists to sort them in ascending order and then apply your logic accordingly to get desired results. You can refer python documentation for more details on sort() method of lists https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists . Note that you have to write your own logic here and you cannot use any built-in functions or methods here except sort(). Also, don't worry about error handling here i.,e., when there is no input or empty input etc., as our test cases will take care of it for you (but still do consider those cases while solving this question). You can assume that all inputs will be valid only i.,e., integers, non-empty lists etc., so don't worry about type checking etc., but keep in mind that you have to handle empty input case as well while solving this question so that it doesn't give an error when executed on our system (i.,e., if there is no input or empty input then just return -1). The reason why we are asking you not to use any built-in functions or methods other than sort() is because we want you guys to practice more on writing your own code instead of relying too much on built-in methods which may make your life easy but may not help much with interviews where interviewers expect candidates who can write their own code instead of relying too much on built-in methods which they might already know since they know python very well themselves :). This problem statement may look easy but it's not so easy as it looks like :) . So, try hard before looking at solution :). All the best! Happy coding! :)",
