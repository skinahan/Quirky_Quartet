If it is divisible by both return 0 else return 1. Return -1 if the input parameter is not an integer. The output of the function should be an integer. Use try and except block to catch exceptions. If the error is not handled in the code raise it again using raise statement. Also handle exception IndexError and ValueError raised by list index out of range and invalid literal for int() with base 10: '' respectively, without raising them again in the code. Return -1 when these exceptions are encountered. You may use built-in functions int() and str(). Do not use any other built-in functions or use any lambda functions while solving this question.
