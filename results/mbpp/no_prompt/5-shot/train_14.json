The string is case insensitive. Ignore special characters, numbers and spaces. Print the result as a list of tuples with key as letter and value as its number of occurrences. Order the result alphabetically. In case of tie, order the result by ascending order of count values. Also print the sum of all counts at last line as shown below in given sample input/output. If no letters are present in given string, print 'No letters found'. Note that you should not use any built-in functions or methods for this question except for those that were mentioned above and should not use any other data structures to solve this problem (like dictionaries, lists etc.). You can write additional helper methods if required but they should not be recursive or iterative (loops). You may assume that input will always be valid and non-empty string only containing alphabets (a-z) and special characters like !@#$%^&*()-+=[]{}|\\:;\"'<>,.?/~`_ . Also note that you don't need to preserve case while comparing or printing letters. For example 'A' is considered same as 'a'.   Sample Input 1 :  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Sample Output 1 : [('a', 1), ('b', 1), ('c', 1), ('d', 1), ('e', 1), ('f', 1), ('g', 1), ('h', 1), ('i', 1), ('j',1 ),('k',1 ),('l' ,1 ),('m' ,1 ),('n' ,1 ),('o' ,1 ),('p' ,1 ),('q' ,1 ),('r' ,1 )] Total Count = 17 Sample Input 2 : \"Hello World!\" Sample Output 2 : [(\"!\",2)] Total Count = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t     \"\"\"",
