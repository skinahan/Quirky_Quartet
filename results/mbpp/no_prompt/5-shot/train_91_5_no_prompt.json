The dominoes can either be placed horizontally or vertically. You are required to complete the function countWays() which takes an integer N as input and returns the number of ways to fill 3 x N board. The value returned by your function will be displayed by driver code. Since this answer can be very large, you need to return answer modulo 10^9 + 7. For example, if N = 30 then output should be 15622200 and not 1562220015622200. If your answer is different from the expected output, then you will get Wrong Answer verdict. Note that there are few test cases where this constraint won't apply so please read constraints carefully before submitting your solution. Please note that we have already initialized array dp[100001] with all 0s in driver code so you don't need to do it again in your code.

Trailing 0's occur when 2 or 5 is a factor. So removing them won't change the value of answer. For example, 200! has three trailing zeros so we remove them to make our calculation easy and it doesn't affect our answer which is 2 at tens place and 6 at ones place (236). So we remove three zeros which make our calculation easy as 200 / 10 = 20, 20 / 10 = 2 and 2 / 10 = 0 (Ans) but 236 is same as 200! when 3 zeros are removed from it. And this will be true for all numbers with trailing zeros in their factorials because removing trailing zeros won't affect the value at tens place and ones place because they are not affected by factors 2 or 5 which produce these zeros. For example, consider 100!. It has two trailing zeroes so if we remove them then we get 142857 which is same as 100!. So removing trailing zeroes will not affect out answer because factors 2 or 5 do not affect the value at tens place and ones place but only produce these trailing zeroes so removing them does not affect our final answer which is 14 at tens place and 2857 at ones place (142857). And this will be true for all numbers with trailing zero's in their factorials because factors 2 or 5 do not affect the value at tens place and ones place but only produce these zero's so removing them does not effect our final answer which remains same whether there",
