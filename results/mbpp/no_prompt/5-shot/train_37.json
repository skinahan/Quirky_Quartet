By a fixed monthly payment, we mean a single number which does not change each month, but instead is a constant amount that will be paid each month. In this problem, we will not be dealing with a minimum monthly payment rate. The following variables contain values as described below: balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as decimal monthlyPaymentRate - minimum monthly payment rate as decimal For each month, calculate statements on the monthly payment and remaining balance.
