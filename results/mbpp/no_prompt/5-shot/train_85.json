For example, if we have an array [1, 2, 3], then we have three choices: [1], [2], and [3]. So the maximum sum is 4 (1 + 3). If the array is [-1, 2, 3], then you can choose either [-1] or [2, 3]. In this case, the maximum sum is 4 (-1 + 3). You should return the largest possible sum. If there are no non-adjacent elements in your array or if it's empty, then you should return 0. Note that empty arrays don't contain any elements at all. The input will be an array of integers. Your output should be an integer representing the maximum possible sum of a sub-array with no adjacent elements. For example: maxSubsetSumNoAdjacent([75, 105, 120, 75, 90, 135]) -> 330 ([120 + 210]) maxSubsetSumNoAdjacent([7]) -> 7 maxSubsetSumNoAdjacent([]) -> 0 maxSubsetSumNoAdjacent([5,-5,-5,-5]) -> 5 Task Write a python function to solve the above question.
