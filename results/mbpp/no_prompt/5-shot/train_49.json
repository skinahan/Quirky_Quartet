The length of the list must be greater than or equal to 5. If not, raise an error with an appropriate message. Don\u2019t use any built-in functions or methods. You can use only \u2018if\u2019 statement once in your code. And also don\u2019t use any loops (for loop or while loop). For example: if input is [4, 2, 1, 3], output should be [4, 1]. The first element in the output list is maximum element from the input list and second element is minimum element from the input list. If you are using Python version 2 then you can use only one print statement for printing both maximum and minimum elements separated by space (without quotes). In python version 3 you can print two values separated by comma (without quotes) within one print statement. Note that we are not considering any built-in functions/methods like max(), min(), sort(), etc., for this question. Also note that we are not considering any loops like for loop or while loop for this question as well. Your code must be less than 10 lines long including comments and docstrings (if any). Also it should contain only one if statement without any logical operators like \u2018and\u2019 or \u2018or\u2019 used in it to solve this problem efficiently without using loops or built-in functions/methods mentioned above. You can use conditional operator 'a if c else b' which works as follows: if boolean value of c is True then evaluate expression a and return its value otherwise evaluate expression b and return its value instead. This operator is also known as ternary operator because it takes three arguments/operands to work upon them effectively similar to binary operators which takes two operands/arguments to work upon them effectively similar to unary operators which takes single operand/argument to work upon it effectively similar to nullary operators which doesn't take any operand/argument at all but still performs some useful operations on their own without taking anything from outside",
