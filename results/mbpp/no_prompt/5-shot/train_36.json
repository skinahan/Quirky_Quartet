The list can contain any number of sub-lists. The function should be recursive.  For example, sum([1,2,[3,4],[5,[6]]]) = 21. Note that it should also work for other data types like strings and tuples.   You can assume that each sub-list will contain only integers or more sub-lists. Also note that you need to handle the case when the list is empty.   If you are using Python 2, make sure to use xrange() instead of range() as range() returns a list in Python 2 which won't work with your code since you are trying to avoid using lists as much as possible in this exercise (you could convert it to a list but that defeats the purpose of this exercise).   For example, sum(xrange(1000000)) should be 499999500000 instead of [0,...,999999] which is what range(1000000) returns in Python 2. In Python 3 however range() returns an iterator so it works fine with your code out of the box (no need to use xrange() in Python 3).   You might want to check out how xrange() works by looking at its documentation here https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#xrange . It's basically just an iterator (like range()) but doesn't store all values in memory at once like range() does so it's more efficient for large ranges (although for small ranges it doesn't really matter). The advantage is that you can use xrange() with very large numbers and not worry about getting an OverflowError or MemoryError since it doesn't have to store all values in memory at once like range(). For example try doing sum(xrange(10**100)) and you'll see what I mean even though 10**100 is way too big for an int (which has only ~309 digits) since we're not storing all numbers from 0 up until 10**100 in memory at once but rather we're storing just one number at a time and",
