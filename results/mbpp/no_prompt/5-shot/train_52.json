This question will be graded manually by our mentor team. So, do not change any part of code which is given as input to your code except for adding your code at appropriate place in main() function only (i.e., do not remove/modify any existing code). Do not add any imports or use any other modules except math module (i.e., do not use sqrt() method from math module). Do not write anything outside main() function body i.e., you should only write one line of code inside main() body i.e., call your user defined method with proper arguments and print the returned value using print(). Do not create an object for this class while writing solution for this question as it will lead to errors during evaluation as we will be creating objects of classes written by you during evaluation of all questions in assignment 1, 2 and 3 separately (i.e., we will be evaluating each question separately so that you can get immediate feedback on each question). You can assume that input will always be an integer type value greater than 0 and less than 2^31-1 . Also, it is guaranteed that no test case will have 0 as input (i.e., you needn't consider 0 as an input in your program). You are allowed to define your own functions/methods wherever required but only one method should contain actual logic which solves this problem i.e., user defined method with proper arguments must be called from main() body with appropriate arguments passed from main() body itself i..e, all logic must reside inside one user defined method only which should be called from main() body with proper arguments passed from main(). If there are multiple such methods then our mentor team will choose anyone among them randomly at evaluation time (which may lead to unexpected results if you have more than one solution methods",

The parameter n is the number of stairs and m is the maximum number of steps that can be taken at a time. For example if you are standing at the bottom of stair case and you can take 1, 2 or 3 steps at a time then if there are 5 stairs then there are 13 different ways by which you can reach to top. If there are 20 stairs and you can take up to 6 steps at a time then there are 10946 different ways by which you can reach top. You have to write a python function that takes two integer numbers n and m as input and returns an integer denoting the total number of possible ways using which we can reach top from bottom taking maximum m steps at each step. If it is not possible to climb any more stairs then return 0 (zero). For example if n = 5 and m = 3 then output should be 13 (see explanation below). Note that this problem is different from Fibonacci series where we had to find fibonacci(n). Here we have to find total number of ways so that we can reach top from bottom taking maximum m steps at each step. Also note that this problem is similar but different from coin change problem where we had given infinite supply of coins but here we have limited supply i.e., only up-to m steps allowed in one move hence its not exactly same as coin change problem (but related though!). Inputs: Two integers n and m where n represents total number of stairs in staircase while m represents maximum allowed moves in one move Output: An integer denoting total number of possible ways using which we can reach top from bottom taking maximum m steps at each step Constraints: 1 <= n <= 30 0 <= m < 7 Sample Input #00: 5 3 Sample Output #00: 13 Explanation #00: We need minimum 4 moves out of 5 moves i.e., 4 moves with 1-step + 1 move with 2-steps + 0 move with 3-steps OR 3 moves with 1-step + 2 moves with 2-steps + 0 move with 3-",
