Return the length of the longest common sub-string. If no such sub-string is found, return 0. Note: The characters in a string can repeat itself. Example: \"abcab\" is a sub-string of \"aababc\". But, \"aba\" is not a sub-string of \"aababc\". It should be read as a sequence of characters in both cases and not as a set of characters. For example, \"aba\" is accepted as a sub-string of \"aabaab\", but not as that of \"baaa\". Also, you can use only one loop in your code and no other library functions are allowed other than ord() and chr(). You may assume that there will be only lower case English letters [a - z] in both strings and the lengths do not exceed 100000 characters each. Input Format : The first line contains two space separated strings s1 and s2 respectively Output Format : A single integer value indicating the length of the longest common substring Constraints : 1 <= |s1|, |s2| <= 100000 where |s| represents the length of string s Sample Input 1 : abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz Sample Output 1 : 26 Sample Input 2 : abcde fghij Sample Output 2 : 5 Sample Input 3 : abcde xyczf Sample Output 3 : 0 Task: Write python function to solve above question.

The subarray should contain at least one element. Return None if there is no such subarray. If there are multiple such subarrays with same maximum sum, then return any one of them. If the given list is empty or None, then return None. For example, given the array [0, 1, -3], it should return 1 and for array [0], it should return 0 and for array [-3], it should return -3 and for array [0, -3], it should return 0 and so on. Assume that all the numbers in the list are positive integers greater than or equal to zero (no negative numbers). Do not use any built-in functions/modules/libraries for this task. You can write additional helper functions as needed but do not modify the signature of existing functions or add new parameters to them. Use only local variables inside a function; do not access global variables from your code (otherwise your code will fail some hidden test cases). Also do not mutate/modify any input lists or arrays; if you need to make changes to input data structures then copy them into new data structures before modifying them (otherwise your code will fail some hidden test cases). Your code will be tested against hidden test cases which check whether you are using global variables inappropriately or modifying input lists inappropriately or using built-in functions/modules/libraries inappropriately etc., so please take care while writing your code! Also note that this question has been asked in interviews by many companies including Microsoft and Google in recent times so please solve this question carefully! And finally note that this question has been asked several times on various platforms including LeetCode so please try solving it first on your own before looking at solutions online! Good luck! :)   Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.
