We need to find the element that occurs more than once and whose index of first occurrence is smallest.  For example, if input array is {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6}, then output should be 5 [index of 5 is 4]. If there are no repeating elements then return -1.  The array length must be greater than 1.   Assume that array elements are in the range from 0 to size-1 where size is the number of elements in array.   Also assume that numbers stored in array are distinct and there are no negative numbers present in an integer array.   If there are more than one such elements then return any one such element (not necessarily first).   For example if input array is {10, 5, 3, 4 ,3 ,5 ,6} then output should be 5 as it occurs more than once and its index of first occurrence is smaller as compared to other repeated elements like 10 which has index 0 but 10 doesn't occur twice while 5 occurs twice so we return 5.   If all elements appear only once then output should be -1 because no element appears more than once and also no single element's index of first occurrence is smaller among all other duplicate occurrences which implies that all elements appear only once so we return -1 as output because it satisfies both conditions (no duplicate exists and also no single element's index of first occurrence among duplicates is smaller).     You may assume that each test case has at least two distinct integers present inside an integer array whose length lies between 1 to 100000 inclusive i.e you may assume each test case has at least two distinct integers present inside an integer array whose length lies between 1 to 100000 inclusive .     So your code will run for at most 100000 * 100000 times overall .     Also you may assume that input consists only of valid values i.e either 0 or 1 or 2 ... or (n-2) or (n-1",
