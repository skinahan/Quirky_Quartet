The derivative of the polynomial f(x) is represented as f'(x). The derivative of a constant value x0 is 0 and the derivative of variable x1 is 1. Use Horner's rule to calculate the first derivative. For example, if we have an input 3x4 - 9x3 + 2 then its first derivative will be 12x3 - 27x2. If we have an input x4 + 3 then its first derivative will be 4x3 + 0. Refer Wikipedia for more information on Horner's rule. Assume that the given expression is a valid polynomial expression and there are no divisions by zero involved while evaluating it. You can use python eval() function to evaluate a string as an arithmetic expression but don't use it in your solution directly, write your own logic to evaluate it using Horner's rule instead of using eval(). Also note that you cannot use any python library functions or built-in functions like pow(), eval() etc... which can directly evaluate expressions for you, you need to implement your own logic here based on what you learned from this exercise or any other source or prior knowledge which may help you solve this problem without violating its constraints. This problem has been taken from Hackerrank site where you can check out more such problems with their solutions once you solve this one successfully and submit it there: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/first-derivative/problem . Note that hackerrank's solution uses eval() but since we are not allowed to use eval() here so please don't refer hackerrank solution until after solving this exercise successfully without using eval(). Also note that we are not concerned about what hackerrank does with our submissions so submitting solutions there won't give us any benefit but if anyone wants to check out other problems similar to this one then they may do so by visiting hackerrank site linked above once they solve all exercises successfully here at codingninjas website! We only used hackerrank link because they have already defined some test cases which could help us verify our solutions easily! So if someone wants to check their solutions against these test cases after solving them then they may do",
