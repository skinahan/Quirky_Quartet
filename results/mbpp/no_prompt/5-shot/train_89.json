If there are multiple such numbers, print the maximum one. If no number is repeated, print -1. Do not use any built-in functions or methods. You can use only two variables and one loop. You should not create any additional data structure like array, list, etc. Do not import any module or library for this question.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. The name of the function should be most_repeated_num().The input and output should be as follows: The input must be a valid python list containing only integers (positive or negative). For example: [1,-2,-3,-4,-5] The output is an integer which is the most repeated element in the input list if it exists otherwise -1 is printed if no element is repeated more than once in the given list as shown below: Input:[1,2,3,4,5] Output:-1 Input:[1,-2,-3,-4,-5] Output:-5 Input:[1,2,3,4,-5] Output:-5 Input:[-10 ,10 ,20 ,30 ,40 ,10 ,20 ,30 ,40 ] Output:40 Input:[10 ,20 ,30 ] Output:-1 Note that you need to write your own code for taking inputs from STDIN and printing outputs to STDOUT without using any built-in functions or methods including eval() etc., Also note that you need to write your own code for handling exceptions/errors if required without using try/except statements. The answer will be evaluated based on correctness of logic used and efficiency of code written by you with respect to time complexity as well as space complexity (memory usage). Please note that we will evaluate your answers with hidden test cases which are different from those provided with sample test cases on our website (this page). Also please note that we may also evaluate your answers by providing additional test cases other than those provided on our website (this page) during evaluation process after submission of your answer by you online through our website (this page). Please make sure that you do not hardcode any",
