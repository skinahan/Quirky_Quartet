If the given list is [1, 2, 4] then your function should return 3 as output. Make sure to write at least three test cases for your program to test whether it works correctly or not.

Also make sure that you don't modify the original list in any way.

No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nQuestion:\rWrite a function to check whether two lists are identical or not. They are identical if they contain same elements in same order. The elements must also be hashable and comparable using == operator as well as is operator. The lists can have different lengths also but they should contain equal number of similar elements in similar order too. For example [1,2,'a'] is not identical with [1,'a',2] but [1,'a',2] is identical with [1,'a',2]. Also [] is identical with [] and not with []. Note that you need to write custom code for this problem rather than using any built-in functions like sort(), zip() etc which are already implemented by default in python. You can use any built-in functions or methods which operate on sequence objects like list, tuple etc but avoid using sort(), zip() or any other similar function or method directly or indirectly (i.e even by converting the parameters into some sequence type first). You can use len() method though since it doesn't modify its argument unlike some other methods like reverse(). If you want additional information regarding sequence types then visit here . Note that your code will be auto-evaluated by our back-end so do not include any extra print statements while writing your code except debugging purposes (if required). Also note that mutable objects like dictionaries cannot be used as keys of dictionaries because they are not hashable unlike immutable objects like integers, strings etc which are hashable by default and hence can be used as keys of dictionaries without error/exception being raised even though they might get modified later after being inserted into dictionary as keys (this behaviour is called rehashing).
