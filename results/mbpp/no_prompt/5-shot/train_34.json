The graph is represented by adjacency matrix representation. The value of (i, j) will be 1 if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j and the value will be 0 if there is no edge from vertex i to vertex j. For example, consider below graph with 4 vertices represented by the adjacency matrix representation. The maximum number of edges that can be added to above tree so that it remains a Bipartite Graph is 3 and adding three edges will make it like below tree which is also a Bipartite Graph as all vertices can be divided into two sets where all vertices having odd degree should belong to same set and all vertices having even degree should belong to another set. For example, below tree can be divided into two sets {0, 2} and {1, 3}. Here we have added three edges (1-2), (2-3) and (3-0). So the output should be 3 for above input graph. Note that there are other ways also like adding edges (1-3), (2-0) and (3-2). But they are not considered as they do not form a single component unlike the first one which forms a single component after addition of three edges. For example, consider below input graph which has 5 vertices represented using adjacency matrix representation where each row represents outgoing edge from source vertex while each column represents incoming edge at destination vertex.. The maximum number of edges that can be added to above tree so that it remains a Bipartite Graph is 5 and adding five edges will make it like below tree which is also a Bipartite Graph as all vertices can be divided into two sets where all vertices having odd degree should belong to same set and all vertices having even degree should belong to another set.. Here we have added five edges (4-0), (4-1), (4-2), (4-3) and (0 - 2).",
