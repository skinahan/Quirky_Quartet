In case of 3*2 board both will contribute as there is one way for each case. For example if we place first vertical then horizontal then we get one way and vice versa. So total ways will be sum of two ways from both cases i.e., from A and B array values at index n which is nothing but last element in each array which gives us total ways for 3*2 board as shown below :- print(count_ways(3)) print(\"Number of ways : \",count_ways(3)) Output:- Number of ways : 5 Explanation:- How many possible solutions are there? If you look at this problem closely you can see that this problem is just an extension of Fibonacci series problem where f(n) represents number of possible solutions for a given input n. So if you look at f(5), it can be calculated by adding two previous values f(4) and f(3). Similarly if you look at f(4) it can be calculated by adding two previous values f(3) and f(2). Let's take an example where we have an input as 4 units long",

Ignore the case sensitivity. If the given string is empty then it should return empty dict. The order of key value pairs in dict does not matter. For example if input is \"Shakespeare\" then output should be {\"s\": 2, \"h\": 2, \"a\": 3,\"k\": 1,\"e\": 3,\"p\": 1,\"r\": 1}. Note that 'S' and 's' are same. Similarly 'e' and 'E' are same. You can assume that only alphabets are given as input and there will be no spaces or numbers or special characters etc in input string. Also you don't need to worry about any other types of inputs except for the one specified above for this problem statement. You can just ignore them and return an empty dict when you encounter them instead of throwing an exception etc as this is not a valid case for this problem statement. You can assume that all inputs are valid according to the problem statement defined above and you don't have to write code to check for validity of inputs or handle exceptions etc as that would be done by other code which calls your function before calling it with actual arguments passed by users/caller code but only after verifying that they are valid according to definition given here in this problem statement itself so you don't have to worry about any such validation logic or error handling etc yourself as those would already be taken care by caller code which calls your function but only after verifying that they conform to definition specified here in this problem statement itself so you can just focus on solving the actual problem without worrying about any such additional stuff like handling invalid inputs/exceptions/error cases etc which would already be handled by caller code before even calling your function with actual arguments passed by user/caller code so you don't have to worry about any such additional stuff like handling invalid inputs/exceptions/error cases etc yourself as those would already be taken care by caller code before even calling your function with actual arguments passed by user/caller code so you can just focus on solving the actual problem without worrying about any such",

This is the key step! You need to reset it when there is no match. Otherwise you'll get wrong result. For example \"ABBA\" and \"ABAB\" will have common substring \"AB\". But if you don't reset it then you'll get wrong answer when comparing last \"AB\" with first \"AB\". So you need this line here! It's called DP :) I hope that helps!
