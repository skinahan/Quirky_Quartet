The harmonic sum is the sum of reciprocals of the positive integers. The function should return the nth harmonic number. Note that the harmonic sum is logarithmically divergent and its value at n tends to infinity as n approaches infinity. Hence you can expect large test cases with large values of n. Also note that your answer will be accepted only if it is within 10^-5 absolute or relative error compared to our reference solution. Use math module in python to calculate log value of a number. For example, math.log(10) gives you 2.302585092994046 which is equivalent to log10(10). Similarly, math.log(2) gives you 0.6931471805599453 which is equivalent to log10(2). Also note that using inbuilt functions for calculations might lead to TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) error in some test cases where very large values are used for calculations using these functions and hence it is advised not use any such functions for this question (like pow() or factorial() or any other such function). Instead use basic arithmetic operations like multiplication (*), division (/) and addition (+) etc as far as possible while solving this question and avoid using such functions which might lead to TLE errors when very large values are used for calculations using these functions due to their slower execution time compared with basic arithmetic operations like multiplication (*), division (/) and addition (+) etc as far as possible while solving this question due to their slower execution time compared with basic arithmetic operations like multiplication (*), division (/) and addition (+) etc when very large values are used for calculations using these functions due to their slower execution time compared with basic arithmetic operations like multiplication (*), division (/) and addition (+) etc . For more information on how different programming languages compare on execution speed check out this link https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r19&hw=ph&test=fortune&l=zijzen-1 .
