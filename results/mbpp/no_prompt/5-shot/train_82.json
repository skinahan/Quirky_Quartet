The coin denomination values given are in the sorted order, i.e., largest to smallest. Assume that you have an infinite supply of coins for each of the denominations. Also assume that you need to find the minimum number of coins required and not necessarily all possible combinations that can make up that value. For example, if you have denomination values 1, 2, 5 and 8 and a sum is 11 then your program should output 3 as it would require three coins with value 5 to get the exact change required (i.e., 11 = 5 + 5 + 1). You may use Python's built-in sort function or implement your own sorting algorithm as per your choice but it should be efficient enough to handle large inputs within a reasonable amount of time. If there is no combination possible then output -1 as answer. Note: You may assume that there will always be a solution possible for all test cases (as per above assumption). Also, since Greedy algorithms do not always yield optimal solutions but just an approximate solution so please add appropriate comments wherever needed in your code explaining why you chose some particular approach/algorithm over others or any other relevant information which might help us understand how you arrived at your solution and why it is correct/optimal/best fit etc., This will help us better assess your understanding of various concepts behind this problem statement and how well can you reason about them instead of just blindly applying some formula or concept without really understanding its implications on problem solving approach etc., So please ensure to provide proper comments along with your code explaining what exactly are you doing at each step so that we can better evaluate whether or not you have understood various concepts behind this problem statement correctly or not! Note: We reserve full rights to award partial marks based on our assessment criteria even if only part/sub-part of your code works correctly! So please ensure to write clear and readable code so that we can easily understand what exactly are you trying to achieve at each step instead of blindly copying",
