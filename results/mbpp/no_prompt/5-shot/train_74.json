Return 0 for null string. The numbers can be separated by any character like space or comma etc.. The maximum length of the string is 1000 characters and there will be only one kind of separator used throughout the string. All characters in the string will be numeric only [0-9]. You need to write an efficient algorithm to solve this problem and code it in python language only. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer : def sum_of_numbers(str1): sum = 0 # Initialize result l = len(str1) # Calculate length of the list str1 # Traverse through all characters of input string and update current value for i in range(l): # Compute product of digits & add it to result sum += int(str1[i]) return sum Question : Write a function that accepts two parameters as strings consisting of words separated by spaces with any number of words (including zero) and returns True if they are anagrams (contain exactly same words irrespective of their order), False otherwise .
