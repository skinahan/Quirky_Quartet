For example, if you are given the string \u201caabacbebebe\u201d, the longest substring with 3 unique characters is \u201ccbebebe\u201d. Note that there may be more than one answer so return any of them. If there is no such substring, then return an empty string \"\". Assume that there will only be lower case letters [a-z] in the input string. The input string size can be arbitrarily large and you cannot use library functions to solve this problem. Also, you can assume that k will always be less than or equal to 26 (the number of letters in alphabet). So your algorithm should run in linear time at most (O(n)). You may not use any extra space other than what is required by your solution (i.e., O(k)). Also, you cannot modify the input string but need to return a new one which has all lower case letters [a-z].\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question and also write necessary comments and docstrings for it as well as test cases to show how it works on different inputs?
