The median is the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. If there are an odd number of values, then median is the middle value. If there are an even number of values, then median is average of two middle values. Assume that input list is always sorted and contains no duplicate values. Also, assume that all elements in input are integers. For example, [1,3,5] has a median value 3 and [1,3] has a median value 2 (which is an average of 1 and 3). The output should be returned as float data type if the input contains an odd number of elements; otherwise it should be returned as integer data type. For example, if the input list is [1,2], then function should return 1 because it's an integer; however if input list is [1], then output should be 1.0 which is float data type for this case (because single element has no pair to take average with). You can assume that there will be only one unique median value for any given set of numbers in a list (i.e., you don't need to handle cases where two or more numbers have same frequency). \nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.
