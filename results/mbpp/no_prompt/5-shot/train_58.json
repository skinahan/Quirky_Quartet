The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, factorial(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24. The function should return None for negative numbers. For positive numbers the output should be as expected. Hint: You can use recursion or use math module's factorial() method which will give you direct output without writing any logic. But your code should be able to work with both input types (positive integers and negative integers). Also you can use math module only if you are using recursion, else it is not allowed to use math module in this question. If you are using recursion then please do write some logic and don't just call the built-in method directly from your code because that will not help us evaluate your coding skills, instead it will show that you are good at googling :). Also note that if the input is an integer then it has to return an integer otherwise it has to return None type object as mentioned above. Please do mind this point while writing your code because we have automated test cases which checks whether your solution is correct or not and also checks its runtime performance as well so make sure that your code passes all those test cases otherwise you won't receive any points even if your answer is correct but its performance is not good enough according to our test cases execution time constraints (which we cannot disclose here due to NDAs signed with our customers but let's just say that they are very strict). So please think about how much time each line/operation/function call takes in your code so that it performs well enough according to our test case requirements :) . And finally don't forget to write comments wherever necessary such as main function, function names etc... Also make sure there shouldn't be any spelling mistakes anywhere like variable names, comments etc.. It might cost you points if there are",

You can assume that the input is a text file. The output should be a dictionary with words as keys and their frequencies as values. You can use any programming language to write your map reduce code but you are expected to write only map and reduce functions without any library calls for other Hadoop functionalities such as partitioning, shuffling etc., which are already implemented by default when you use Hadoop Streaming API. The input will be fed from standard input and the output will be printed to standard output which you need to redirect it into an output file or print it on screen depending on your programming language choice. Please do not use any external libraries other than those available in Python Standard Library, Java Standard Library, Scala Standard Library or Perl Core modules for this task except Hadoop Streaming API if needed based on your choice of programming language (i.e., Python, Java, Scala or Perl). Also note that the number of reducers should be 1 while running your code using Hadoop Streaming API.
