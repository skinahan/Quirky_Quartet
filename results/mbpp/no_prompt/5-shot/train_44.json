No additional comments and docstrings are needed. The code should be written in 3 lines. Refer the sample input and output for formatting specifications. The code should be written in 3 lines of python code only (excluding blank lines). Please do not use any other functions or datatypes like lists, dictionaries etc. If you do so your answer will not be evaluated properly as we will use different set of inputs to test your program. We encourage you to write your own logic and avoid using library functions wherever possible . However if you want to use any library functions please make sure that they are available on our online compiler platform which is used by us to evaluate your answer before displaying it on the screen. You can access this platform at https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/python-puzzles/. Please note that we will not provide any support for this platform and it\u2019s usage is entirely at your own risk . For more details about our evaluation system please click here . This is an open challenge with no time limit so feel free to take as much time as you want . However , once again note that we will only allow 2 attempts per user id per challenge (provided that it has been published) , so please make sure that you submit a correct solution within these 2 attempts only or else you may get locked out from participating further in this challenge . Also note that this problem statement may change slightly over time due to editorial reasons or bug fixes by our evaluation system , so make sure that you keep checking this page periodically over next few days before submitting your final solution . Good luck ! Happy coding ! :)  Sample Input : [1,1,0,1] Sample Output : 2 Explanation : There are two contiguous sequences of 1's - [1,1] & [1]. Note : Do not assume anything about n",
