If the input values are not valid then return -1. The input values can be extremely large, so make sure your code can handle it efficiently. Also, write additional code to test your function and make sure it is working correctly. You may use any additional functions as required. You may create new lists/tuples/dictionaries as required to solve this problem but you are not allowed to use any built-in functions or methods that solve this problem by themselves with no additional coding required on your part. You must write the entire code yourself including the main program that calls your function and displays the result returned by it when executed with various inputs (please include at least 5 different sets of inputs). Your code should be clean, well organized, properly indented and commented, and should have meaningful variable names that are easy to understand even for someone who is not familiar with your solution approach or algorithm used by you to solve this problem. Make sure you test all possible cases before submitting your solution for grading! For example: If one of the input parameters is negative, both parameters are negative, both parameters are equal etc... Also make sure you check if both parameters have been entered correctly by the user before calling your function using these values! Your program should display an appropriate error message in case of invalid input parameter values or incorrect number of arguments passed into it from command line (for example if only one argument was passed instead of two etc...) In case you need help with understanding how command line arguments work in Python please refer to: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-python/ You will also find a very useful video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQJG7BfYxgw&t=115s Please do not change any existing lines in this file other than adding your own name at top after \"Student Name:\" as instructed above!

If the sum is greater than 9, repeat this process until it becomes single digit. Return that single digit number. For example, if input is 12345, sum of digits will be 1+2+3+4+5=15; now if we repeat this process, sum becomes 1+5=6 and it is a single digit number now, so we return 6 as output. If input is 123456, then output will be 3 (as 3 is a single digit number). You can assume that input always has at least one digit. Do not use any built-in function or library function to perform this operation. You can write additional helper functions as needed but do not modify the definition of the given function prototype in any way and do not create new python files and do not import anything from other packages or modules except from standard python library packages only (i.e., you are allowed to import math but not numpy or pandas). Do not use global variables anywhere in your code/solution except for constants (if any). Do not use mutable data structures such as lists/arrays/dictionaries etc unless specified otherwise in question description/text above your coding area below; however, you may use immutable data structures such as tuples whenever you need them without restriction on their usage other than what's mentioned above and below your coding area; finally, you may declare any constant variables you need but make sure they are used only inside your own functions and they are named properly according to Python naming convention rules; also note that all inputs will be valid numbers so there's no need to check for invalid inputs or handle exceptions related to invalid inputs in your code/solution here - just solve the problem!\rTask:\rWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Write additional helper functions if needed but no global variables should be used anywhere in your code except constants (if any).
