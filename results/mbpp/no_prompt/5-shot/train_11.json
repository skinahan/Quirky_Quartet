No additional comments and docstrings are needed. You can add additional variables as required but do not change any existing variable names or argument names or argument types or number of arguments or order of arguments in which they are passed to this function definition (or returned by this function). You can use existing functions but do not define any new functions for this task and do not use any built-in functions except max(). Do not import any library module explicitly (do not use statements like import math etc.). Also you should avoid using global variables inside your solution code/function definition code, unless you have some very good reason to do so and you know what you are doing! Note that we will check your code against our own test cases and also with different test cases that we generate ourselves using random data generation techniques (so please make sure that your code is robust). You must also write some additional test cases yourself which should be sufficient enough to cover all possible cases when it comes to testing this problem statement/question on its correctness (with respect to expected output). Your solution must be completely self-contained without needing any external library modules other than those which come as part of Python standard library distribution itself such as math module etc.. Your solution must be able to run on our own platform unmodified without needing anything else installed on our platform other than Python interpreter itself for running your Python source file! We will test it against our own custom hidden test data after submission deadline is over! So make sure that it works correctly with all possible corner case inputs before submitting it online! Also note that we will run all submitted solutions on a single CPU core with 1 GB RAM limit per process for efficiency reasons so please keep memory usage under control by avoiding excessive memory allocations inside your solution code!",
