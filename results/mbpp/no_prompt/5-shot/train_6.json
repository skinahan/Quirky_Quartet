The function should return the reversed string without vowels. Example: For \"Hello World\" it should print \"dlrow olleh\".  Note that capitalization does not matter here i.e. whether a letter is in upper case or lower case, you need to consider only the small letters for vowel removal. You can use built-in functions or write your own logic to solve this question.  \rTask: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. The function name should be reverse_remove_vowels(). The input parameter of this function is the string itself and it returns one output which is the reversed string without vowels as described above in example section. Please note that you are not allowed to use any built-in functions for this question other than len() which gives length of any sequence (string, list etc.). You can write your own logic for reversing and removing vowels from given input string but you cannot use any built-in functions other than len() in your solution code other than those mentioned above .
