You can assume that 'k' is smaller than or equal to length of array. You have to return the largest sum of any subarray of size 'k'. If there are multiple such sub-arrays, then you have to return maximum among all those sub-arrays. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution. No need to print anything. You just have to find and return the answer. Also, if there are multiple answers possible, you can output any one of them. No need to print anything. You just have to find and return the answer. Also, if there are multiple answers possible, you can output any one of them.
