If there are no unique characters return None. Note: Consider only alphabets as characters and ignore numbers and special characters. If there is more than one non-repeating character return the first one. Example: \"abcdab\" returns 'c' and \"abcbad\" returns 'd'. Ignore case sensitivity i.e consider 'A' and 'a' as same character. Ignore whitespaces i.e consider \"abc abc\" as same as \"abcabc\". Handle empty strings appropriately returning None or an appropriate error message. The function should not modify the input string in any way other than removing whitespaces if any present at the beginning or end of the input string before processing it further (if you choose to remove them). You can assume that all inputs are valid strings without any special characters or numbers etc., just alphabets, uppercase or lowercase letters with or without spaces at start/end of input string (if any). Also, you can assume that all inputs are given in lowercase only for your convenience and you don't have to worry about converting them to lowercase yourself before processing further - this is because we want you to solve this problem using your own logic/algorithm without using built-in python functions/methods like .lower(), .upper() etc., which would make it too easy for you otherwise :). Also note that we expect a unique solution for each test case irrespective of its order in test cases list, so if your solution outputs say 'b' instead of 'c' when called with input=\"abcdab\", it will be considered wrong even though both answers are correct but we expect our solutions to be deterministic i.e output should be always same every time we call our function with same inputs irrespective of their order in test cases list etc., which may not be true if you use random/unpredictable functions like random(). Task: Write a python function named find_first_non_repeating_char() which accepts a single argument representing an input string consisting only of lowercase letters ('a'",
