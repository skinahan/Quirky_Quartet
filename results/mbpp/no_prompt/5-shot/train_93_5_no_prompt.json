If the number is greater than the length of list, return -1. Do not use any built-in functions or len() method. The solution should be in O(n) time complexity and constant space complexity. For example, if given list is [10,5,-3,4] and nth element from end is 3 then output should be 4. Elements are counted from end to start that means last element is at 0th position and first element at 3rd position. Similarly for second last element index will be 1, third last element index will be 2 and so on..   Input Format : First line contains an integer N denoting size of input array Second line contains N space separated integers denoting elements of input array Third line contains an integer k Output Format : Print required output as mentioned above Constraints : 0 <= N <= 10^6 Sample Input 1 : 5 10 5 -3 4 6 Sample Output 1 : 4 Sample Input 2 : 5 10 5 -3 4 6 Sample Output 2 : 3 Sample Input 3 : 5 10 5 -3 4 6 Sample Output 3 : 2 Sample Input 4 : 8 8 9 8 7 7 6 6 5 Sample Output 4 : 7 Explanation for sample testcase 1: Here k = 3 so we have to find third last element in list which is present at index (length \u2013 k). Length of list = 5 \u2013> [10,5,-3,4,6] So required output = List[2] which is equal to 4 . Explanation for sample testcase 2: Here k = 2 so we have to find second last element in list which is present at index (length \u2013 k). Length of list = 5 \u2013> [10,5,-3,4,6] So required output = List[3] which is equal to 4 . Explanation for sample testcase 3: Here k = 1 so we have to find first last element in list which is present at index (length \u2013 k). Length of list = 5 \u2013> [10,5,-3,4,6] So required output = List[4] which is equal to 6 .",

Return the index of the element if found, otherwise return -1. The given array must be sorted in ascending order. The function should take three arguments - value, start and end index of the array and return the result based on the search result. If no start or end is provided, then it should consider 0 and n-1 as default values respectively where n is the length of array. Note that you can pass only one argument at a time while calling a function with multiple arguments (default arguments are used for other parameters). For example, if you want to pass only value argument then call it as follows: binary_search(value), if you want to pass only start and end indexes then call it as follows: binary_search(start=start_index, end=end_index). You can also pass all three arguments at once or any combination of two arguments like binary_search(value=value, start=start_index), etc., but make sure that default values are used for other parameters which are not passed explicitly by you while calling this function. Also note that passing parameters out of order will result in an error so make sure that correct parameter names are used while calling this function. For example, passing first argument as start instead of value will result in an error since we have mentioned value first after self inside this method definition so first argument has to be passed as value only when calling this method from outside this class definition else it will result in an error due to invalid syntax.'''\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nQuestion:Write a python program which takes input from user and checks whether it is palindrome or not?'''",
