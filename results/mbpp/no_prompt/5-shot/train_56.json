According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself). Example: The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2 and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14.

The input list will be sorted. The input list can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well. For example, suppose the input list is [0, -1, 2, -3, 1], and the given sum is -2. One pair that sums to -2 is (-3, 1). Thus the output should be 1. Note that (-3, 1) and (1,-3) are considered as same pair since order doesn't matter in this case. Therefore only one such pair exists in this test case. Similarly for other test cases also you have to take care of duplicate pairs. You may assume that all keys are distinct in input list but there can be duplicate values as well as negative numbers too in the list along with positive numbers. And you should not consider any pair twice which has been already considered earlier by ignoring its order or considering it's order or both ways because eventually it will lead to double counting of same pair which we don't want here for this question e.g., if a given array contains elements [5 4 6] then there are 3 pairs whose sum is equal to given value 7 i.e., (5 6), (4 6), (5 4). But if you consider both orders of each pair then it will lead to double counting e.g., your output should not be like this [(5 6), (6 5), (4 6), (6 4), (5 4), (4 5)] rather your output should be [(5 6),(4 6),(5 4)]. Output should contain only unique pairs irrespective of their orders e.g., either [(4 5)] or [(5 4)] but not both because they represent same pair having elements at index 0th and index 2nd positions respectively from the given array i-e A[0]+A[2]=7 and A[2]+A[0]=7 so these two indicate same thing so we don't want them twice rather once is enough for us hence output must contain either one of them but not both here from above example case as they represent same thing actually so please note that carefully when coding your solution for this question because",
