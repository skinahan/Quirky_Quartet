Ignore all non-number values except for '+' which is a valid operator for addition. If any non-number value is encountered, return None. If the list does not contain any numbers or if it's empty, return 0. The '+' operator will only be used to add positive integers. No other operators will be used and no subtraction will be allowed. The list can contain both integers and strings as elements and the numbers in the string should also be added to the sum. For example, ['a', 1, 2, 'b', +3] should return 6 because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. However, ['a', 1, 2,'b','+3'] should also return 6 because '+3' is considered as a string which when converted to an integer means 3 and since it's preceded by a '+' sign it becomes positive and thus counts towards the sum of all elements in the list regardless of whether they are strings or integers. Note that if there are multiple consecutive non-numbers such as ['a','b','c'] then you have to consider them together as one single non-number value so that your function can continue processing further elements from where it left off after encountering this non-number value. So for example if you encounter such a case like ['a','b','c',1], you have to consider them together as one single block so that your function can resume processing from index 3 i.e., index of 1 which is an integer (and not from index 0 i.e., index of 'a'). Similarly if you encounter something like [1,'a','b','c'], then you need to process this case as well by considering them together as one single block so that your function can resume processing from index 3 i.e., index of 'c'. To summarize: Anytime your function encounters any sequence of consecutive non-numbers such as ['a','b','c'] or ['-','/'] etc., it has to treat them together as one single unit",

Assume that you can only move either down or right at any point in time. The first row and first column of cost matrix are filled with zeros. The task is to complete the function minCostPath(). It takes three arguments m, n and cost[][]. It should return an integer denoting minimum cost path from 0, 0 to m-1, n-1. You may also use one or more helper functions which takes three arguments m, n and cost[][]. Elements of matrix can be either positive or negative integers. If we start from top left corner of matrix then we can reach its bottom right corner by using some moves like down or right side movements only so we have to choose minimum possible moves so that we will get minimum possible sum of elements visited during our movement through matrix till its bottom right corner position i.e., last element of matrix if it is given as input otherwise up to any position before last element if it is not given as input but number of rows and columns are given as input along with elements of matrix itself.. In short you need not calculate sum while moving through each element but you have calculate sum while reaching at bottom right corner element which will be your result after execution of program on any input data set..

If the character occurs more than once, then the order of characters should be maintained. For example if \u201cPython\u201d is given as input then the output should be \u2018P\u2019 1 time, \u2018y\u2019 1 time, \u2018t\u2019 1 time and so on. The string will contain only lowercase letters. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. For example P 2 y 2 t 2 h 1 o 1 n 1 is not valid output but P 1 y 1 t 1 h 2 o 3 n 4 is valid output. Order of characters must be maintained as per their occurrence in input string. So P 2 y 2 h 2 o 3 n 4 is also valid output but not valid according to problem statement because order of characters must be maintained as per their occurrence in input string like P 1 y 1 h 2 o 3 n 4 . So P 2 y 2 h 2 o 3 n 4 is not valid output according to problem statement because order of characters must be maintained as per their occurrence in input string like P 1 y 1 h 2 o 3 n 4 . So P2y2h2o3n4 is also not valid output because space between each character and its count are required like P1y1h2o3n4 . Similarly Pyythhon or PythonP or pYthon or any other combination will give wrong answer even though they may appear correct due to presence of same set of characters with same frequency but they are wrong because they do not maintain order/sequence of characters as per their occurrence in given input string which is required by question statement.
