For example, if the input is 7 then the output should be 111. If the input is 12 then the output should be 1100. The output should be in string format. Do not use any built-in functions or modules for this problem. You are also not allowed to import any module for this problem. If you have solved this problem using recursion, then try to solve it without using recursion, and vice versa. Also make sure that your code does not have any infinite loops when evaluated with certain inputs (e.g., 0). You can assume that the input will always be a positive integer greater than or equal to zero, but you cannot assume that it will always be less than or equal to 2^31 - 1 (i.e., you cannot assume 32 bits of storage). Hint: what would happen if you keep dividing by 2? What would happen if you kept multiplying by 10? Think about how these operations may help you in solving this problem efficiently without using recursion, and vice versa (i.e., how might they help with implementing a recursive solution?). If your solution uses recursion, try using memoization as an optimization technique for your recursive algorithm to improve its efficiency (you can try memoizing both top-down and bottom-up approaches). Note: There are many different ways of solving this problem; we do not expect everyone's solutions to look exactly like ours! We encourage you to think outside of the box! Also note that some sample test cases are provided at the end of this document; however, these test cases are only meant as examples of possible inputs and outputs, so they may not cover all edge cases (we will run additional tests on your code when grading it). To get full credit for this question on Gradescope, make sure that your code passes all of our hidden test cases as well!
