The pattern can overlap itself.  For example, if the pattern is \"ab\" and the string is \"abababa\", then there are 3 matches. Please note that, we need to find all occurrences of a pattern in a given string and not just first occurrence. That means, if there are overlapping occurrences then count all of them. For example, if the pattern is \"aa\" and the string is \"aaa\", then there are 2 matches (not one).   You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters (a-z).   If you want to solve this problem using regular expressions, you can use re.findall() method for finding all matches in a given string as shown below:   import re   result = re.findall(pattern, text)   Here result will be list of all matches found in text using pattern as regular expression object. You can also use re.search() method from regular expression module to find whether a match exists or not as shown below:    import re    match = re.search(pattern, text)    Here match will be an object containing information about first match found or None if no match exists between text and pattern objects used as arguments for this method call (refer documentation here). You may also use other methods like re.match(), etc., which you might have learnt earlier while solving problems on regular expressions (refer Regular Expressions section here). However, please note that we have used only these two methods from regular expression module for this problem statement and it is advised that you don't use any other methods from this module unless asked explicitly by interviewer during interview rounds because these two methods are sufficient for solving this problem statement and using other methods might lead you to incorrect solution even though it might work correctly on some test cases due to time constraints during interviews where every second counts! Also note that time complexity of your solution should be O(n+m), where n is length of text and m is length of pattern because we need to traverse through each character once only while doing matching operation between text and pattern which takes O(n+m) time complexity at worst",
