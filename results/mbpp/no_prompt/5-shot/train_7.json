If the sum is greater than 9 then repeat the process until it becomes single digit. For example if given number is 12345 then sum of digits will be 15 ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5). Now since sum is greater than 9 we need to repeat the process again and get the result as 6 ( 1 + 5). This result should be returned from the function. If given number is negative then return -ve sign with result. For example if given number is -12345 then return -6 as output. If input is 0 then return 0 as output.  Note: The function should not generate any error or exceptions and handle all possible input values without using any user defined libraries or functions except abs(). You can make use of abs() builtin python function only once in your code to handle negative numbers.  Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer: def sum_of_digits(num): while num > 9 or num < -9: temp=num if num < 0 else -num res=0 while temp != 0: res += temp % 10 temp //= 10 num = res return num\n\n \n\n Question: Write a python program to find out whether a given string has all unique characters or not without using any additional data structure like set or dictionary etc., Task: Write a python program to solve the above question with proper logic and explanation on how you solved this problem using comments in your code wherever necessary. Please do not use any builtin functions/libraries/data structures except string data type which contains all alphabets in lower case only (a \u2013 z). You can assume that input string will contain only lower case alphabets ('a'-'z'). Answer",
