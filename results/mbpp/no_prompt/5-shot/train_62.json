If n is negative, then return -1. If n is positive, then return 1. Else return 0. Also write a test case to test your program. Note: Do not use any in-built functions for computing digits sum and write your own logic. The function name should be digit_sum(). Test your code by using pytest or unittest library functions. Write a main function which calls this digit_sum() and prints the returned value from digit_sum() on console as output with suitable message as shown in example below: For example: If user enters an integer number as 12345, then output will be 15 (i.e., 1+2+3+4+5). For another example: if user enters an integer number as -1234, then output will be -1 (i.e., negative input). For another example: if user enters an integer number as 0, then output will be 0 (i.e., zero input).
