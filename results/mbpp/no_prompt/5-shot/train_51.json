The coefficients of the polynomial are provided in the form of a list. The function should return a list containing the nth derivative coefficients, with highest order first. The length of the list must be equal to that of original polynomial coefficients. If n is greater than or equal to the length, then return an empty list []. Also, if any coefficient is not an integer then round it off to nearest integer and return that as well rounded off values in result list. If all coefficients are zero after rounding off then also return an empty list [].
