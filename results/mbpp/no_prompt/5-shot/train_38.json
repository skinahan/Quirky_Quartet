The longest consecutive elements sequence is defined as the one with maximum length (number of elements) among all the consecutive elements sequences. For example, if the input list is [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], then the output should be 4 as the longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].   In this case also note that sequence can start or end at any place in list i.e., 1-2-3-4 or 2-3-4 or 3-4 are all considered as different sequences with same length but different element orderings.  If two sequences have same length then print them in ascending order of starting point of sequence.   If there are more than one sequences with same length and starting point then print them according to their ending points in ascending order.   If there are still more than one solutions (sequences) with same length and both starting and ending points then print according to their second element in ascending order i.e., use second element as tie breaker while printing output sequences.   Note that input list may contain duplicate numbers which should be considered only once while finding longest consecutive sequence from it e.g., if input list is [20, 4, 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5] then output should be 5 instead of 6 as 20 appears only once even though it can form a subsequence of length 6 by repeating itself but we consider it only once while finding longest consecutive subsequence from given input numbers e.g., 20 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 which has total 6 numbers but here we consider only first occurrence of 20 while finding the solution hence correct answer would be 5 instead of 6 here because we consider duplicates only once while calculating total number of elements present in solution subsequence). Please write efficient code to solve this problem without using any builtin functions/classes etc... The time complexity requirement for your code is O(N). Where N is size/length/count/total number of elements present",
