The first two terms are 1 and 1. The next term is computed as the sum of the previous two terms. The nth term is computed as n-1 + n-2.  For example, the 5th term is 3 (1+1+1).  The 8th term would be 13 (3+5+8).  If the given number is less than or equal to 0, then raise an exception with a message \"Number should be greater than 0\". If it's not an integer, raise an exception with a message \"Number must be an integer\". If it's not a positive number, raise an exception with a message \"Number should be positive\".
