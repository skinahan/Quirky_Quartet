The input list can contain both integers and strings. If the list is empty, return None for the minimum and maximum element. If the list contains integers only, return a tuple containing min and max integer (not string). If the list contains strings only, return a tuple containing min and max string (not integer). If the list contains both integers and strings, convert all integers to string type before comparing them. For example, if an input list is [5, \u201c3\u201d], it should be converted to [\u201c5\u201d, \u201c3\u201d] before comparing them using lexicographical order. You can assume that there are no duplicate elements in the given input lists. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. You can write your own test cases for testing your code by running below command on terminal/command prompt after installing pytest package with pip install pytest command: pytest \u2013v question7_solution.py . The file name must be question7_solution .py . Note that you need to use Python 3 for this task as Python 2 doesn't support unittest module which is used by pytest internally. Also note that you cannot use any other third party module or package like numpy , scipy , etc as they are not installed in our system by default so you will get error while running your code on our system if you use any such module or package which is not installed already on our system by default when we run your code on our system for evaluation purpose during interview process of this role at Amazon Development Center India Pvt Ltd., Hyderabad location . We will also evaluate your coding style during evaluation of your performance during interview process of this role at Amazon Development Center India Pvt Ltd., Hyderabad location . So please follow PEP8 guidelines while writing code for this task as well as other tasks given to you during interview process of this role at Amazon",

A palindrome is a string which reads the same backward as forward. For example, \u201cmadam\u201d is a palindrome. The function should ignore cases and punctuations while checking the string. Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer: def checkPalindrome(s): s = s.lower().replace(' ', '').replace('.','').replace('!','') return s == s [::-1] Question: Write a function to find all pairs of numbers from list whose sum is equal to given number Task : Write a python function to solve the above question .
