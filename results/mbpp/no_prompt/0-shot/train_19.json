We could use an array instead of a list but that would only help with memory usage since arrays are mutable but they don't have the same methods as lists so it would be more difficult to implement this solution with arrays vs lists. The solution below will still run in O(N^2) time complexity though because we're iterating over all possible substrings of length i + 1 for each value of i from len down to 1 which is N + N-1 + N-2 ... 2 + 1 operations or N * (N+1)/2 operations which is still O((N^2)/2). This can be simplified down to O((N^2)/2). The space complexity should also stay at O((N^2)/2) since we're creating an array of size N * (N+1)/2 each iteration through the outer loop which will happen len times or len * ((len+1)/2) times where len is our input string's length so our total space complexity should be len*((len+1)/2)*((len+1)/2), simplifying this gets us back",
