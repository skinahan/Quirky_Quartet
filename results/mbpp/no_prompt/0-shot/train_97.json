If substring is not found, return -1. The function should be case sensitive and should work for both small and capital letters. Do not use any inbuilt functions for this question. You may assume that the string would only contain small letters and no spaces. For example, if the input string is \"this is a test string\" and substring is \"t\", then output should be 11 (index starting from 0). If the input string is \"this is another test\" and substring is \"t\", then output should be 2 since t occurs twice in the input string but we are looking for its first occurrence. Similarly, if the input string is \"abcdabcdabcd\" and substring is \"bc\", then output should be 1 since b occurs before c in alphabetical order as defined by ASCII values of characters (b = 98, c = 99). However, if we are looking for last occurrence of b or c in this case, then answer would be 3 because b comes after c alphabetically but it appears before c in original order of characters as defined by ASCII values (b = 98, c = 99). For this problem use ASCII values to determine order between two characters. You may use ord() function to get ASCII value of a character or chr() function to get character corresponding to an integer value between 0-127 (both inclusive). Do not make any assumptions about inputs other than what has been stated above. You can write additional helper functions as needed but you cannot modify signature of given function which means that you cannot change number or type of parameters or return type of this function definition. For example, you can add additional parameters such as startIndex or endIndex but you cannot change signature such that it takes only one parameter instead of three because that would mean it's no longer same problem statement with same constraints on inputs and outputs as stated above! \nAnswer: \n'''\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# def find_first_occurrence(inputString , subString):",
