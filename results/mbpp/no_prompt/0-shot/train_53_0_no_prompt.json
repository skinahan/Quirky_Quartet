Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer: def cube_volume(side): volume = side ** 3 return volume Question: Write a function to find the surface area of a cube. Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer: def cube_surface_area(side): surface_area = 6 * (side ** 2) return surface_area Question Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6 using if statement or conditional statements in Python? Task Print all numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6 using if statement or conditional statements in Python? Answer for i in range(6): if i==3 or i==6 : continue print(i) print(\"bye\") Question How do you check whether an integer is positive or negative number in Python? Task In this task, you will be given an integer number as input from stdin which can be positive or negative number, you need to write code that checks whether it is positive number or negative number and display appropriate message on stdout . For example, If input is -5 , then output should be Negative Number If input is 5 , then output should be Positive Number . Note1 : You don't have to write any import statements in your code for this task Note2 : Don't use any conditional statements like if , else etc for this task Note3 : Use int() method provided by Python standard library while taking user input Sample Input 1 -5 Sample Output 1 Negative Number Sample Input 2 5 Sample Output 2 Positive Number Answer num=int(input()) if num>0 : print(\"Positive Number\") elif num<0 : print(\"Negative",
