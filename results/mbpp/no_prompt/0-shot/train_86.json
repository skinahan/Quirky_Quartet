The factorial of n is denoted as n! and calculated as the product of integer numbers from 1 to n. For example, 5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120. Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer: def factorial(n): if n == 0 or n == 1: return 1 else: return n * factorial(n - 1) \n\n \nQuestion: Write a function to reverse an integer array by using recursion. Task : Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed Answer : def reverse_array(arr, start, end): if start >= end: return arr mid = (start + end) // 2 arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start] reverse_array(arr, start + 1, end - 1) \n\n \nQuestion : Write a function that accepts two positive integers x and y as arguments and generates a 2-dimensional array containing x * y elements such that element at position [i][j] is i * j . Task : Write a python function to solve the above question No additional comments and docstrings are needed Answer : def gen_matrix(x ,y ): matrix = [[0 for i in range (y)] for j in range (x)] for i in range (x): for j in range (y): matrix [i][j] = i * j return matrix",
