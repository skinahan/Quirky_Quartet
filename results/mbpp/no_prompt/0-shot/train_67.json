Similarly, if input is \"moonmen\", then output should be \"o\" instead of \"m\" because M occurs twice (once as upper case and once as lower case) whereas o occurs only once (as lower case).     If there exists no non-repeating letter at all, then we simply return None which satisfies problem statement's requirement that function should return None when there is no non-repeating letter at all in given input string .      For example, if input is empty string \"\" or consists of all repeating characters like \"sssssssssss\", then output will be None which satisfies problem statement's requirement that function should return None when there is no non-repeating letter at all in given input string .      Note : We use count() method to count number of occurrences of each character in given input String .
