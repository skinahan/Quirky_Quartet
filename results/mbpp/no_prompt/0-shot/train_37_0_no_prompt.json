Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed for the answer function, but you should write comments and docstrings for all other functions used in the program including main() . Answer: def area_of_circle(radius, pi=3.14159265359): area = pi * radius ** 2 return area # Question 3: Question: Write a function to calculate the difference between two dates in number of days where both dates are passed as strings in \"dd/mm/yyyy\" format as arguments of the function and also make sure that if any one date is invalid then it should raise an exception with an appropriate message otherwise if both dates are valid then it should return number of days between them as an integer value (excluding end date). Task: Write a python program to solve the above question which will include three functions including main() . The first two functions will be used to validate date string and calculate number of days between two valid dates respectively whereas third one will be used as main() function which will take input from user and call first two functions accordingly based on input data validity and print appropriate messages based on exceptions raised by first two functions or final result returned by second function (as per given conditions). You should use comments, docstrings etc appropriately in your solution program for better readability of your code by others who may need to understand your code at some point in future even if they are not familiar with python language syntax at all because this is one of most important coding practice which you must follow while writing any program no matter what language you use for coding purposes i-e even if you have written this solution program just for fun or learning purpose only but still it is good practice that you must follow while writing any code so that when you will start working professionally then this habit will help you save lots of time & efforts during code review process at work place so that others can understand your code easily without spending too much time on reading it again & again or without asking questions from you again & again about how your",
