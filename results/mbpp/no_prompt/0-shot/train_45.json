The function returns the number of cubes of size 'k' that can be formed from a cube of size 'n'. When 'k' is greater than 'n', then there are no cubes of size 'k' that can be formed from a cube of size 'n'. When the value of any one input is less than or equal to zero, then the function returns zero. If both inputs are equal to one, then the function returns one as only one cube can be formed. Else, it calculates the number of cubes by calculating (n - k + 1) ^ 3 as explained in question statement.\n\n  For example, if we have a cube with side length 4 and we want to know how many smaller cubes will fit inside it with side length 2, we need to subtract 2 from 4 which gives us 2. This is because you need at least two units in each dimension for there to be space for a smaller cube inside the larger one. Then you add 1 back because you need an extra unit on each side for the edge cases where there's only room for exactly two units in each dimension. So now we have 3 units left over in each dimension which gives us 3 x 3 x 3 = 27 different possible locations for our smaller cubes within our larger one.'''",
