The function returns the list of strings which are not anagrams of the given input string. You can assume that all inputs will be valid.  For example, if the input is [\"act\", \"cat\", \"dog\", \"tac\"], and the given string is \"cat\" then it should return [\"act\", \"dog\"].   Write a python function to solve this problem.

For example, if the input is 5 (which is 101 in binary), then it should return 2 as there are two consecutive ones in its binary representation.

Accept two integers values form the user. If the first one is divisible by the second one, display the result True else display the result as False. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Answer:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \ndef multiple(m, n):   # m and n are integer values taken from user input. Return True or False based on whether m is divisible by n or not. Hint: Use modular operator to check if there is any remainder when m is divided by n or not. Return true if there is no remainder else return false. Note that you can use == operator instead of = operator in Python language which will be helpful here as you have to compare two values and return true or false based on comparison result instead of assigning value somewhere. You can also use multiple assignment feature in Python language where you can assign multiple variables at once using comma separated list of variable names on left side and comma separated list of values on right side (i-e x=10,y=20). This way you don't need to take separate inputs for two variables separately as shown in below example code snippet here: def multiples(m,n): # m and n are integer values taken from user input x = int(input(\"Enter value of x:\")) y = int(input(\"Enter value of y:\")) z = x + y print(\"Sum of\",x,\"and\",y,\"is\",z) return z Here we have used input() function available in python which takes user input and returns it as string so we have used int() function to convert returned string into integer type before storing it into variable named \"x\". Similarly we have used print() function available in python which displays output on screen similarly like cout<<\"something\" works in C++ language except that it doesn't automatically add new line character at end unlike C++'s cout statement does unless specified explicitly using 'end' parameter with some other value than default newline character (i-e print(\"something\",end=\"\")). So we have used end parameter with default newline character explicitly at end here (i-e print(\"something\",end=\"",
