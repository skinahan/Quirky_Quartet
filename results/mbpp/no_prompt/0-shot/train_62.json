This will be done by adding 1 to our starting number every iteration. So we start at 0 and add 1 every iteration until we reach our goal or hit an impossible scenario. This makes sense because after all you can't get any higher than 2^31-1 so you have to start somewhere low like 0 and work your way up as high as possible before you hit an impossible scenario (2^31-1). The reason why this works is because of modulo math which states that any time you divide two numbers together like this \"5 / 3\" you will always get a remainder of either 1,2, or 3 depending on what 5 divided by 3 equals which in this case would be \"3 remainder 2\". So when I say \"5 / 3\" I am really saying \"3 remainder 2\". This means that after each division operation there will always be some sort of remainder left over which means when dividing 5 by 3 for example you would end up with something like this \"15/3\", \"18/3\", etc... In other words each time I divide 5 by 3 my answer gets bigger but my remainder stays exactly the same at 2 every single time! This means that eventually I'll hit some point where my answer gets big enough so now instead of",
