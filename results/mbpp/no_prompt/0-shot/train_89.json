No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\n\n  Answer:def remove_duplicates(list):\n    unique_set=set()   #declare an empty set which will contain only unique elements of the input list.\n    for i in range(len(list)): #iterate through each element of the input list and add it to unique_set if it is not already present in it.  The add() method doesn't do anything if the element is already present in the set, hence we can use this method to check for duplicates as well as adding elements to set simultaneously.  This way we don't need two loops, one for checking duplicates and other for removing them from original list. Also this uses less space as compared with using another array or another variable of same type as original variable to store only unique elements and then copying them back later on after removing duplicates from original variable/array/list etc .   This is called in-place algorithm or program which means you are modifying your original data structure rather than creating new data structure with same data but without duplicates or some other modification like sorting etc .   Also this uses O(n) time complexity which is much better than previous approach's O(n^2) time complexity (since we are using 2 nested loops).     Anyway its always better to use built-in methods provided by python rather than writing our own logic from scratch because these methods have been tested by thousands of people before being released so they will be more efficient, optimized and bug free than our own version of code written by us unless you are writing code for some big company where performance matters a lot or you are preparing yourself for coding interviews where you need to write efficient code on white board without any help of IDE or internet etc .   Here I am assuming that you want your code/function/method etc .to be very efficient so that's why I am suggesting this method instead of simple one liner solution given below because most interviewers ask how would you optimize your solution even further so they can test how good problem sol",
