If there is no common prefix, return an empty string \"\".\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. The name of the function should be longestCommonPrefix. The function should take input as described and return the answer as described in the question above. No additional imports are required for this problem. You can use built-in functions available with Python 3 (and not any other library). For example, you can use len(), enumerate(), zip() etc without importing anything else. You can also use list comprehensions if you know how to use them (they're really cool!). Here's an example: new_list = [x**2 for x in range(10)] would assign a list with values 0, 1, 4...81 to new_list variable (you can try this in your interpreter). This is just an example; you don't have to use list comprehensions if it's not comfortable for you or if you don't know how they work (they're optional). All inputs will be valid lists of strings and all outputs must be valid strings as per expectations mentioned above (no None or other invalid values). You will receive points only if your code passes our test cases and time limit on our platform after submission; so make sure that your code is efficient enough to pass both these tests before submitting! We recommend that you try out your solution on your local machine before submitting it on our platform because we do not give points if it times out on our platform but works fine locally! Also note that we do not give partial/full marks for partially correct solutions; either all test cases must pass or none of them must pass! You cannot get partial marks even if some test cases fail due to timeout but others pass! The time limit per test case is 5 seconds and memory limit per test case is 256 MB by default - these limits may change without prior notice during/before contest so please make sure that your code runs within these limits before submitting! If you have any doubts about correctness of your solution after reading the problem statement, please feel free to ask us via discussion forum -",
