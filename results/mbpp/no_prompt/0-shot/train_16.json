Also no need to sort again as we have already sorted it in previous step by converting it into set. If we use list then we need to sort the array in order to find duplicate elements which will take extra space and time both. And if we use dictionary then also we need to traverse through all the elements in order to check whether an element exists or not which takes extra space and time both. So using set is better than using either dictionary or list here as both dictionary and list will take same amount of space but more time than set whereas set will take less amount of space but less amount of time than dictionary or list here. So overall using set is better than using either dictionary or list here as it takes less amount of space as well as less amount of time than either dictionary or list here. As size gets larger this difference becomes much more pronounced so that's why using a hash table (dictionary in Python), which has constant look-up times on average makes sense when dealing with large inputs because otherwise you might be waiting hours just for your program to read through each element one by one in order to compare it with other elements which can be avoided by simply storing all the elements into a hash table (dictionary in Python), which has constant look-up times on average so that you can easily check whether an element already exists or not within",
