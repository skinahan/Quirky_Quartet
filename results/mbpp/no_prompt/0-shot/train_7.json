This is done to reduce space complexity. The first row and column are used to store the original values of Bell's number. The other rows are used to store intermediate values during computation. We can also do this using two arrays and reduce space complexity further but this will increase time complexity as we need to copy one array into another before each iteration. So, it's a trade-off between time and space complexity. We can use a similar approach to find Catalan numbers as well which are defined similarly as Bell's numbers but with some difference. I'll leave it up to you guys if you want me to write about that too (in python). It's easy once you understand how Bell's number is calculated using dynamic programming/memoization technique. You can also refer GeeksforGeeks or WikiPedia or any other resource on Internet if you want more information on Bell's number or Catalan numbers :) If you have any doubts regarding this post then please feel free comment below :) If you like my post then please share it with your friends/colleagues :) Happy learning !!!!!
