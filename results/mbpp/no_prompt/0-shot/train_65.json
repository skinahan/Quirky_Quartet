Modify the function by adding an argument, separator, so it will also convert to the kebab case (i.e.this-is-camel-case) as well. Answer: def to_snake_case(s): result = [s[0].lower()] for c in s[1:]: if c in string.ascii_uppercase: result.append('_') result.append(c) return ''.join(result).lower() def to_kebab_case(s): result = [s[0].lower()] for c in s[1:]: if c in string.ascii_uppercase: result.append('-') result.append(c) return ''.join(result).lower() Question : Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers (a list where the elements are in order from smallest to largest) and another number . The function decides whether or not the given number is inside the list and returns (then prints) an appropriate boolean . Answer : def binarySearch (arr, l, r, x): # Check base case if r >= l: mid = l + int((r - l)/2); # If element is present at the middle itself if arr[mid] == x: return mid; # If element is smaller than mid, then it can only be present # in left subarray elif arr[mid] > x: return binarySearch(arr, l, mid-1, x); # Else the element can only be present in right subarray else: return binarySearch(arr, mid+1, r, x); else: # Element is not present in the array return -1; Question : Write a Python program to get a string made of 4 copies of the last two characters of a specified string (length must be at least 2 ).
