Note: Do not use built-in functions. Answer: def minMaxNum(num): num.sort() return num[0],num[-1] print(\"Minimum number is\",minMaxNum([2,-4,-6,-8])[0]) print(\"Maximum number is\",minMaxNum([2,-4,-6,-8])[1]) Output: Minimum number is -8 Maximum number is 2 Question: Write a function to find the average of a sequence of numbers. Note: Do not use built-in functions. Answer: def avgSeqOfNum(*args): sum=0 for i in args: sum+=i return sum/len(args) print(\"Average of given sequence of numbers is\",avgSeqOfNum(-4,-6,-8)) Output: Average of given sequence of numbers is -6.333333333333333 Question: Write a function to concatenate all elements in a list into a string and return it. Answer: def concatAllElementsInList(*args): result=\"\" for i in args : result += str(i) return result print(\"Concatenated string is \",concatAllElementsInList('a','b','c')) Output Concatenated string is abc Question : Write a function which accepts two arguments (list & n). The first argument consists\u00a0of\u00a0numbers (integer type only), while second argument denotes the length\u00a0of\u00a0the list to be considered from the beginning or end (positive or negative value). The function should return the maximum element after considering only first n elements when n>0 or last n elements when n<0 . If n == 0 , then it should return None . Assume that abs(n) <= length of list . Also assume that all values are integers in the list . Answer : def",
