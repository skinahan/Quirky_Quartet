Data Structures are used to store the data in an efficient manner and perform operations on them efficiently. Some of them are immutable and some are mutable. Some of them have order and some don't have order. Some of them can be used as keys in dictionaries but some cannot be used as keys in dictionaries because they don't support hashing which is required by dictionary keys to perform efficient lookups using key values instead of indexing or iterating over each element to find out the desired element which would be very inefficient operation for large datasets with millions or billions of elements. So we must choose correct data structure according to our needs like if we want our data structure to have order then we will use ordered data structures like lists or tuples or ordered dicts etc., if we want our data structure not to have order then we will use unordered data structures like sets or frozensets etc., We can also use deque if we want our program's performance not get degraded over time due to memory management issues when appending elements at end or deleting elements from beginning because it uses both ends for insertion and deletion so that it doesn't need memory allocation everytime when appending at end after deleting from beginning because there is no space available at end so that new memory allocation needs to be done everytime which causes degradation in performance over time due to memory management issues but deque doesn't suffer from this problem because it uses both ends for insertion and deletion so that there is always space available at either end after deletion so that new memory allocation isn't needed everytime when inserting after deleting which avoids degradation in performance over time",
