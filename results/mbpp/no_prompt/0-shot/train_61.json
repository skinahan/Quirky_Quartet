A function is just that - something that takes an input, runs some code and returns an output. A class is more complicated, and usually contains multiple functions (called methods) as well as some data (called attributes).  You can put a function inside a class, but it's not necessary to do so.  It's also possible to put data inside of a function!  Functions are great for small tasks where you have one or two inputs and one output. Classes are great when you have lots of inputs and outputs, or when you need to store some intermediate results along the way.  \nTake this example:  Say I want to write a program that reads in several text files, does some processing on them individually, then combines them into one big file at the end. I could write this all in one giant function, but it would be very hard to read! Instead I'll break it up into two functions and one class:   <code>read_files</code>, <code>combine_files</code>, <code>TextProcessor</code>. The first two functions will be simple - they just take input filenames and produce output filenames as output. The TextProcessor class will contain several methods (<code>.read()</code>, <code>.process()</code>, etc) which allow me to keep track of all my intermediate data while processing each individual file before combining them all together at the end.   Here's what this code might look like:  \n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Note: This code isn't meant to actually do anything useful - it's just meant as an example.</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n    def read_files(inputs):     # This is our first function! It takes inputs...      # ...and returns outputs      return outputs\n\n    def combine_files(outputs):     # This is our second function! It takes outputs...      # ...and returns combined_file     return combined_file\n\n    class TextProcessor:             # Now we define our TextProcessor class         def __init__(self):             self._words = []",
