Return -1 if no second largest number is present. If there are multiple such numbers, return any of them. Return -2 if input array is empty or None. Do not use built-in functions/libraries for this question. Use looping constructs, conditional statements and other programming concepts of your choice to solve this problem. You can write additional helper functions as needed but do not change signature of the function provided to you. Do not modify contents of input arrays either, as they are passed by reference only (not by value). You can also write utility classes/methods and import them, if required but do not use any third-party libraries in your solution nor import any built-in library methods for sorting or otherwise modifying the array contents (e.g., NumPy, Pandas etc.). The solution will be evaluated on following aspects: Correctness, Efficiency and Code Quality/Readability. However, please note that correctness is given higher priority than efficiency or code quality/readability in evaluation criteria for this question because we want to ensure that you are able to provide a correct solution rather than an efficient one with poor code quality and readability (or vice versa). So please focus more on getting the logic right rather than optimizing it or making it look good at first attempt itself since we might ask you questions about your approach during interviews based on your submitted solution even though we have already evaluated it using automated tools and tests during initial evaluation phase of application review process before inviting you for an interview with us.</p>Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.</p><p>No additional comments and docstrings are needed.</p><p>Additional info: Break the problem down into smaller pieces.</p><p>Sorting the input might help you create an efficient solution, use vectorised operations when possible.</p><p>Apply recursion where possible.<br /></div></div></div></div></div></div></span><style type=\"text/css\">#MathJax_Zoom {position: absolute;background-color: white;overflow: auto;display: block;z-index: 301;padding",
