Use the three sides as arguments to the function and use them to calculate the area of a triangle. The function should return None if the side lengths are not valid for a triangle (i.e., they cannot form a triangle). If all sides are equal, then return equilateral in place of area value and if two sides are equal return isosceles in place of area value and if no two sides are equal return scalene in place of area value. Note: Area should be rounded off to 2 decimal places after calculation for all cases except when it is None or when it is either equilateral or isosceles or scalene based on its side lengths being valid for a triangle or not and being equilateral or isosceles or scalene based on its side lengths respectively.
