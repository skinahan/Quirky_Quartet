The function should take one argument: an integer n and print all ways to arrange two vertical dominoes in a row, that is, print all (x, y) pairs such that 0 <= x < y < n, where (x, y) denotes a domino which has been placed with one square at position (0, 0) and the other square at position (x, y). Note that (0, 0) denotes the upper-left corner of a 3 x n board in which we want to place two vertical dominoes horizontally from left to right without overlapping them or leaving empty space under any of them. Also note that we need to ensure that every column is occupied by exactly one square from some domino because otherwise there would be empty space in this column under one or both dominoes and we are not allowed to leave any empty space under any domino when placing them on our board horizontally from left to right as shown below:Note that we need not worry about rows because each row will be occupied by exactly one square from some domino because our board is only three rows high and each vertical domino occupies exactly two rows on our board when placed horizontally from left ro right without overlapping them or leaving empty space under any of them as shown above in example input/outputs 1-3 above.
