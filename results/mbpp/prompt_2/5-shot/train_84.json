So, we can omit all the numbers which are not possible to be a factor of n. For example, 5 and 7 are the only possible factors of 35. Hence, we need to check till sqrt(35). The factors greater than sqrt(35) will repeat the smaller factors in reverse order. For example, 35 has 5 as a factor and 7 as a factor. If we reverse these two numbers, we get 57 which is also a pair of factors for 35 but it's greater than sqrt(35). So, all the pairs of factors that are greater than sqrt(35) will repeat themselves in reverse order and hence they need not be checked again. This will reduce our computation time by half. This holds true for all numbers except squares of prime numbers e.g., 4 (2 * 2), 9 (3 * 3), 25 (5 * 5), etc., because squares of primes have only odd number of divisors e.g., 4 has 3 divisors 1, 2 and 4 whereas all other numbers have an even number of divisors because every divisor repeats itself in reverse order e.g., 6 has 6 divisors 1, 2, 3, 6 and reversed pairs 2 & 3 and 1 & 6 making it an even number of total divisors whereas 9 has only 5 divisors 1, 3 and 9 making it an odd number but since it's a square number so there won't be any reversed pairs like 2 & 4 or 1 & 8 thus making total count as odd instead even like other numbers except squares of primes..
