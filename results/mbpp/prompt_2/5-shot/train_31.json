Anagram pairs are two words that contain the same set of characters. For example, \"silent\" and \"listen\" are anagram pairs. The number of anagram pairs is 2 for input [\"listen\", \"pot\", \"part\", \"opt\", \"trap\", \"silent\", \"top\"] while it is 6 for input [\"listen\",\"tow\",\"top\",\"pot\",\"part\",\"opt\",\"trap\",\"silent\"] . Note that the number should be independent of case, so 'Top' and 'Pot' are not considered as a pair in the above example. The order of elements does not matter in a pair, so ['part','trap'] and ['trap','part'] are considered as one pair only. The order of output does not matter either as long as you print all pairs once only. For example, printing [['silent', 'listen'], ['pot', 'opt', 'top']] or [['pot', 'opt', 'top'], ['silent', 'listen']] is fine too. Note that you need to consider both upper case and lower case letters while counting anagram pairs. Also note that you need to consider only alphabetic characters while counting anagram pairs i.e., punctuation marks like ',', '/','!','@','#','$',\"%\" etc., should be ignored while counting anagram pairs (elements containing punctuation marks will be treated as separate words). Also note that single letter word should also be considered in finding anagram pairs e.g., input list [\"I\"] should output [[\"I\"]] .\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.
