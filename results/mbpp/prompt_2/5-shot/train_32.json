If there are multiple palindromic substrings of the same length, return the first one. If there are no palindromic substrings, return an empty list. For example: 'abaxyzzyxf' -> 'xyzzyx'. Do not include spaces as part of your substring. Only alpha numeric characters should be included in your substring. Assume that all characters in the input string will be lowercase (a-z). The input string may contain special characters and numbers, but those will not be part of your palindrome. For example: 'A man, a plan, a canal: Panama!' -> 'amanaplanacanalpanama' and not 'amanaplanacanalpana'. Do not use any built-in functions or methods to find or reverse strings. Write your own logic to solve this problem using loops and conditionals only! You may use helper functions if you wish (e.g., isPalindrome). Your algorithm should run with O(N^2) time complexity where N is the length of the input string. You may assume that N will always be greater than 0 when passed into your function and that you do not need to validate inputs from users/callers of your function (e.g., if they pass in an integer instead of a string). Use recursion where possible! Note that you can modify the output list since it is passed by reference into this function! Also note that even though we ask you to use recursion here, it is fine if you don't know how recursion works yet! Just work on implementing this function iteratively for now; we'll learn about recursion soon! You should also try solving this problem without using recursion first as well before trying it with recursion! One more thing - don't forget to add comments explaining what each line does as well as comment headers above each helper function/method describing what they do! This will help us grade your assignment and also help you understand why each line",
