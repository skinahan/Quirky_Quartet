Words are separated by characters like spaces, tabs, etc. and can be of any length. For example, there are two words 'Hello' and 'World' in the following string. The function should also handle sentences with multiple spaces between words. For example, there is only one word 'Hello' in the following string. You can assume that there will not be any punctuation marks or digits in the sentence. Assume that only alphabets will occur as characters and all alphabets will always be lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'). If you are using Python 3 then ignore character encoding issues (assume that all characters are encoded as UTF-8). The input string can contain leading or trailing whitespaces but you have to ignore them while counting words. Also, you need to consider a single space between two consecutive words as one word i.e., it should not be counted as two words just because there is a space between them (see examples below). You need to write an efficient code which does not use any extra memory for storing intermediate results during processing of input string because this code may run on very large strings and we don't want our solution to run out of memory when handling such inputs! Note that we want you to solve this problem without using Python's built-in functions like split(). However, if you don't know how split() works then try implementing it yourself before looking at its definition! It's always good practice to think about how we would solve problems without using libraries or built-in functions which do most of the work for us! However, note that your implementation needs to work with arbitrary strings not just strings which match your implementation's logic! For example, if you have written code which splits a given sentence into individual words based on some specific rules then it should also work fine on sentences where those rules do not apply e.g., if your code expects each word to start with an alphabet but it encounters a word starting with a digit then it should still process this word correctly! When writing your code make sure that you follow best coding practices including proper indentation etc., so",

If the given list is empty, return 0 as its sum. Use recursion concept to solve this problem. Hint: Use slicing concept to get individual elements from the list and add them up using recursion function calls. Return sum to main function and print it out there. Do not use any loops or built-in functions like sum(). For example: input_list = [1, 2, 3] output = 6 (1 + 2 + 3) input_list = [-1, -2] output = -3 (-1 + -2). Note that you should not modify the given list while calculating the sum of its elements using recursion. It should be used only for slicing purpose when required inside your recursive function calls (see above example). Also do not use any inbuilt functions like len(). You are free to define additional functions as per your requirement but do not modify the given function definition or default parameters value/s if any present already (if applicable). For example: You can define another recursive helper function which takes additional parameters like start index and end index of a sub-list where you want to calculate its sum (if required by your solution logic). But do not change default values of start index and end index parameters already present in this problem definition if applicable else you will get an error during evaluation time when we run our automated test cases on your code submission with different sets of inputs which are hidden from you during practice/testing time on our platform here online itself.) In general, we recommend that you try solving this problem without changing default parameter values as much as possible because it will help you learn how to solve similar problems with different constraints imposed on their input parameters which is an important skill needed in real world software engineering job interviews too! We also recommend that you look at other python programming problems available here on our platform before attempting this one so that you can learn how others have solved similar problems efficiently!
