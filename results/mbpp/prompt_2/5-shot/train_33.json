Also write a function to find the total number of occurrences of all words. Ignore punctuations and special characters. Use case-insensitive matching. Order does not matter here. Return a dictionary with key as the word and value as its count. If multiple words have same count then return a dictionary with sorted keys and values in descending order of counts. If two words have same count then sort alphabetically and return it as shown in sample output 1 or else if all counts are different then sort alphabetically and return it as shown in sample output 2 or else if there is only one word present then return this single word as shown in sample output 3 or else if no words are present then return an empty dictionary as shown in sample output 4. Note that you should ignore the order while returning your result for sample outputs 1, 2 & 3 but for sample output 4 you should preserve the order of keys returned by your program since this will be used by our test cases to validate your code submission against expected result from our end due to some technical constraints on our end which we will not be discussing here but you can take my word that this is required at our end :) . Also note that irrespective of whether any punctuations/special characters are present or not, there won't be any extra spaces either at the beginning or at the end of the given sentence string so you need not worry about trimming any extra spaces while splitting your input string into individual words using space character ' ' . You can check out few test cases below which will help clarify these points further:\r\nSample Input 1:\r\nI am going home!\r\nSample Output 1:\r\n{'am': 1, 'going': 1, 'i': 1, 'home': 1}\r\n\n  Sample Input 2:\r\nI am going home!

The only allowed operation is insertion of characters. For example, \"abcd\" can be converted into \"abcdcba\" by inserting a character 'c' at index 3. You can assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to insert additional characters. However, you need to optimize over the number of insertions required and not on space used or characters inserted. If no such palindrome exists then return -1. For example, abcda cannot be made into a palindrome by just adding characters at the end since we will have to insert 2 characters between b and c so that it becomes abcdaca which is still not a palindrome. However, abcde can be made into a palindrome by inserting 2 characters as shown below: abcde -> abcdbe -> abcdbce -> abcdcbde -> abcdcbadae -> abcdcbadaebdae -> ... (continues like this). Note that we have inserted b between d and e in step 2 above which was not necessary but was done just for illustration purpose only. The optimal solution would have been achieved if we had inserted c instead of b as shown below:abcde->abcace->abcacbace->abcacbacbace->... (continues like this) So you can see that there are multiple ways of making a given string into a palindrome but you need to find one with minimum number of insertions required and return this count as your answer for this problem statement. You do not need to actually convert it into any specific palindrome but just need to find out how many such insertions are needed in order to make it into one by following the rules described above. If there are multiple answers then choose any one that works and return its count as your answer for this problem statement. For example, if n=10 then some optimal solutions are:Input String\tNumber of Insertions Required\tCommentsabccccdddda\t0\tAlready a Palindromeegghhiiikklllm\t9\tegghhiiikklllmm",
