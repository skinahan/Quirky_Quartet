Also note that your function cannot change the original list as well so make sure it returns new one instead of modifying existing one or returning same reference.. For example if you pass [4,6,-3,-1] then your function should return [-3,-1,4,6]. Another example would be if you pass [2] then your function should also return [2] instead of [] since 2 is still unique element from that list even though there is only one element present in it.. You can assume all elements in given list will be integers for simplicity but feel free to write code for handling other data types as well.. For more examples look at test cases section below.. Also note that we don't have any restriction on using extra space or memory here except not using built-in functions like sort(), sorted() etc... So you can use extra memory but not extra space here which means no additional data structure like lists/sets/hashtables etc... You can assume inputs will be valid and there won't be any None values in given lists either so don't worry about those edge cases... Lastly",
