Note: The row index starts from 0. In all the following examples, the maximum term in every row is 1. The second maximum term is 2 and so on. For example, consider row 3 which has 1 3 3 1. Here the maximum term is 3 and its position is 2 which corresponds to n=3 and k=2 in nCk. The second maximum term is 3 and its position is 1 which corresponds to n=3 and k=1 in nCk. And so on... You can use math library functions for computing factorials or you can write your own helper functions for it. If you use math library functions then you have to import it as follows: import math You can either use factorial method from math module or write your own helper function for computing factorials. If you are writing your own helper function then it should be defined before calling pascal_triangle function else you will get NameError as shown below: NameError Traceback (most recent call last) <ipython-input-8-c04b6d35d7f0> in <module>() ----> 1 pascal_triangle(4) <ipython-input-6-e9a5d20a88f8> in pascal_triangle(n) 9 10 def pascal_triangle(n): ---> 11 pass 12 13 Task: Write a python function to solve the above question using recursion within 250 seconds of execution time limit with additional comments and docstrings where necessary.

Unique numbers are the numbers which are not repeated in a sequence. Return the unique number as a list in ascending order. If there is no unique number in a sequence then return an empty list. If there are multiple unique numbers then return all of them in ascending order. For example: if nums=[4,3,2,1,4,5] then your function should return [1,2,5]. Note that there can be negative integers as well. Also note that you cannot modify nums array or list object passed to your function (read only). You need to create new output list and return it as answer (have a look at the main() function for clarity). Hint: Use set() data structure to get rid of duplicates and sort() method to sort elements of set object which returns sorted list object containing elements of set object (check python documentation online for more information on set() and sort() method). Also you can use sorted(iterable) method which returns sorted iterable object (list or any other iterable like string etc.). This will save you from creating new output list manually using loops etc., just convert your set into sorted iterable using sorted(set) method and return it directly from your function. For example: if nums=[4,-3,-2,-1,-4,-5] then your function should return [-5,-3,-2,-1]. Don't forget about edge cases! If input is None or empty list [] then return an empty list []. You can write additional helper functions as needed but do not modify our test cases and main program given to you; otherwise tests might fail during auto-evaluation and its hard for us to debug it on our end since we don't see what exactly went wrong!
