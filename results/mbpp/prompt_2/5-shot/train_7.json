If the list is sorted in descending order, create and return a new list containing the ascending order. If the given list is empty, return an empty list. Note that this problem is different from Return Permutation which returns all possible permutations. Return only one next permutation of a given sequence of numbers. The next permutation contains the same number of integers as does the input sequence and rearranges its elements into a lexicographically greater arrangement. For example, if input sequence is [1,2,3] then output should be [1,3,2] and if input sequence is [3,2,1] then output should be [1,2,3]. Refer to wikipedia for more details about lexicographic ordering https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Generation_in_lexicographic_order . For example: Input = [6 5 4 3 2 1] Output = [] Input = [1 2 3 4 5 6] Output = [1 2 3 5 4 6] Input = [9 9 7 7 8 9 8 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 ] Output = [-4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 8 9 7 9 ]  Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.
