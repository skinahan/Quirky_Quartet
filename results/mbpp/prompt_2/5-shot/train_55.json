The list may contain other lists as elements. Use recursion to implement this function. The maximum of the given list is the largest element when compared with all other elements including those within its sublists. The minimum of the given list is the smallest element when compared with all other elements including those within its sublists. If there are no elements in the given list, return None for both min and max functions. If there is only one element in the given list, return that element for both min and max functions (this would be equivalent to returning that singleton for both min and max). For example: if L = [4,[3,[2,[1]]]] then your program should return 4 as max value and 1 as min value (not 3 or 2). Similarly if L = [4,3,[5,6],[[7],8]] then your program should return 8 as max value and 3 as min value (not 5 or 6). Note that you can use python's built-in function len() anywhere in your code but do not use any other built-in python functions/methods like sum(), sort(), etc... You can also assume that none of the lists will be empty except possibly one of them which may be empty (see last test case below). You are not allowed to use any loops anywhere in your code either directly or indirectly by calling any function that uses loops internally like map(), reduce(), filter(), etc... You can only use recursion here! Also note that you need to write two separate functions one each for finding minimum and maximum values respectively. Your program must pass all test cases provided below without errors! Do not change names of these two functions: find_min_list() and find_max_list(). Do not add/delete/change any test cases! Also do not change names of variables used in these test cases! If you do so, our grading script will break down! Here are some sample calls on these two functions along with their expected results: >>> find_min_list([4,[",
