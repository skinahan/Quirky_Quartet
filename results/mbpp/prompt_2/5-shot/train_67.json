Return the length of such substring. For example, if the input is \u201cabcdabcefg\u201d, then output should be 5 (because \u201cabcef\u201d has no repeated characters). If there are multiple answers, return any of them. If there is no such substring, return 0. The runtime complexity of your solution should be O(n). You may assume that n is less than 106. You may use built-in string functions/libraries in your solution, you may write additional helper methods as well if required. Do not modify the signature of given function. Don't worry about null or empty strings either :) . NOTE: Don't use any inbuilt functions or libraries for this question! Write your own logic to solve it! Hint: Use a dictionary to store the last seen index of each character and use this information to decide whether to extend the current valid substring or start a new one! Also note that you don't have to create all substrings and then find out which one is valid and which one isn't! Just keep on expanding your current valid substring as long as possible and when you can't expand it anymore (because a character repeats), start a new one from next index :) .\n\n Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.
