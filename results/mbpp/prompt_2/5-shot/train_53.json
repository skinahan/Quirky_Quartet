This reduces time complexity from O(N) to O(1). #time complexity of this program is O(N).Space complexity is also O(N).We can reduce space complexity by calculating only A value as we dont need B value after calculation of A value .This reduces space complexity from O(N) to O(1). So overall time and space complexities are both reduced by using this recursive formula instead of generating whole fibonacci series upto N terms and then using that generated list for calculation purpose.#reference :https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-number-of-ways-to-fill-a-3xn-board-using-2x1-dominoes/ #code reference : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-the-number-of\u2013ways/ #https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/programming-dynamic\u2013programming\u2013set\u201314/#https://enwikipediaorg/",
