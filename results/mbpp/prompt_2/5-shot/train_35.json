Use recursion to solve this problem. Don't use any loops or built-in functions to solve this question. The function should take an input list as an argument and return the sum of all its elements as output. Note that we don't want you to use any sort of inbuilt functions like sum(). You are expected to write your own code for finding the sum of all the elements in the given list using recursion. You can assume that all inputs are valid lists containing only numbers, no other data types or objects are allowed in the given lists. If an empty list is passed as an input then your function should return 0 as output without failing with any error messages or exceptions. You may use some basic built-in functions like len(), range() etc., but you cannot use any other sorting algorithms or functions which directly gives you answer for this question, even if it is not part of standard library those will be treated as cheating and strictly monitored by our plagiarism checker tool, so do not try it! We expect you to write your own code for solving this problem using recursion and basic built-in functions only! Note that if you are writing helper methods inside your solution then please comment them out before submitting it on edX grader because our grader doesn't support multiple methods inside a single solution file! Also note that if your program crashes on edX grader due to exceeding maximum recursion depth limit then please add some extra test cases which will help us fix our test data set for better coverage! Please read more about python's maximum recursion depth limit here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3323001/maximum-recursion-depth-exceeded-in-python . Our edX graders have Python 3 installed on them so make sure that you write code",
