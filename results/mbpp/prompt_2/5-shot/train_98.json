The consecutive elements sequence can be increasing or decreasing. For example, if the list is [49, 1, 3, 200, 2, 4, 70, 5], the longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5], therefore the length is 5. If no consecutive element sequence exists in the array then return 0. Note: If two sequences are of equal length then return any one of them. If there are multiple sequences with same length then return any one of them. The list has at least one element in it. All numbers will be positive integers only and may not fit even in a 32-bit signed integer data type. So take care while handling large inputs. Assume that this method will be called multiple times with different input lists each time so try to make it efficient as much as possible (use memoization). You may also sort your input before applying your algorithm to make it efficient but that will change your output order which might not be allowed in some cases where order matters e.g., when you need to print all sequences with same lengths together (see examples below). In such cases you can use OrderedDict instead which preserves insertion order and hence output order too (but takes more memory). Input format: A list containing positive integers only Output format: An integer representing the length of longest consecutive elements sequence Examples: Input : list = [5] Output : 1 Explanation : Longest consecutive elements sequence is [5]. Length = 1 Input : list = [10 , 20 , 30] Output : 0 Explanation : No consecutive element present in given array Input : list = [10 , 20 , 30 , 40] Output : 4 Explanation : Longest consecutive elements sequence is [10 , 20 , 30 , 40]. Length = 4 Input :list = [20 , 21 ] Output : 2 Explanation : Longest consecutive elements sequence is [20 21 ]. Length = 2 Task: Write a python",
