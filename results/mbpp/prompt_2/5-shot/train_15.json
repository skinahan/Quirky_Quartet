The two lists can contain any type of elements including duplicates and nested lists as well as different lengths too but they must be equal i.e., same number of elements with same value at each index position till their lengths match else False is returned irrespective of further values in both lists which are ignored since they don't match with each other's length anymore after that point onwards.. For example ([1,[2,3],4],[1,[2,3],4]) returns True but ([[1,2],[3]],[1,[9],8]) returns False because their lengths differ at second index position itself even though both have same first element 1 at first index position and so on... Note that zip() stops processing further when any one iterable gets exhausted unlike map() which continues till longest iterable is exhausted i.e., map() works like while loop where zip() works like for loop which stops at break statement when condition fails unlike while loop which runs infinitely until break statement is encountered in its body... Also note that one-element tuples are written as just an element inside single parentheses pair e.g., (4) not ((4)) or (4,) etc...
