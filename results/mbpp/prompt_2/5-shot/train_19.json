The length of the list is not known in advance. The input will be a tuple and output should be an integer value. You are allowed to use only one heap object (either max heap or min heap) while solving this problem. You can assume that the numbers in the tuple are unique and distinct from each other. Also, you can sort the input if needed before applying any algorithm to solve this problem, but you cannot use any built-in functions or libraries apart from heapq library (for creating heaps). Note that, you should not convert the tuple into another data structure such as list before solving this problem. Also, note that your code will be auto-evaluated by an online judge so do not add any additional print statements for debugging purposes otherwise your submission will fail during auto-evaluation phase. If you have written some debug statements and forgot to remove them before submitting your code, you can resubmit your solution again without those debug statements and it should pass during auto-evaluation phase then. Your solution will run on a different set of inputs from what we used for testing purpose so make sure that your code works well for all possible inputs as well as edge cases such as empty tuples etc., otherwise it may fail at some point during auto-evaluation phase which is out of our control because we don't know what kind of inputs it's going to receive when running on their server side during evaluation phase (it could be some random values or even empty values). So write clean code which works well with all possible inputs including edge cases such as empty tuples etc., otherwise it may fail at some point during evaluation phase which is out of our control because we don't know what kind of inputs it's going to receive when running on their server side during evaluation phase (it could be some random values or even empty values).
