If there are no repeated elements then print -1. The function should return the index of the first element that is repeated. If there are multiple such elements, return the smallest one. The input array will contain only positive integers and will not be empty. For example, if given array is [10, 20, 10, 20, 30] then your function should return 2 as output because 10 is duplicated as 3rd and 4th elements of the array and its index is 2 which is smaller than 3 (index of 20).

If no such pair exists then return empty list .

(this is because this way we will always have a unique element in our 'second_highest' variable which is what we need!)       also note that this will only run if it fails the first test anyway so no need to worry about it running on every iteration of loop unnecessarily! (ie it will only run if 'num' passes through first test and then fails this test)     Also note that we dont have to worry about checking whether 'num' is greater than 'second_highest' before checking whether its equal to 'largest' because by definition if its greater than something then it cant be equal to something else at same time! ie once again this is why we can just check for equality straight after checking for being greater in both cases without worrying about order/sequence of tests!! :)      also note that by putting these",
