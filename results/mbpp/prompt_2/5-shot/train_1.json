If no character is repeated more than once, return -1. Consider only alphabets (a to z). Do not consider upper case characters and special characters. Ignore the repeated occurrences of same character in a string, for example, if input string is \u201cabcdabcd\u201d then ignore both occurrences of 'b' and 'c', and consider only one occurrence of 'd'. The expected time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of input string. The order of characters in output should be same as the order of characters in input. For example, if input string is \"abcd\", then output should also be \"abcd\". Note that input strings are immutable in python, so convert it into a list before processing it (if needed). You can use built-in function ord() to get ASCII value of a character. For example, ord('a') returns 97 and ord('A') returns 65. Similarly you can use chr() to get the corresponding character from ASCII value as shown below: chr(97) returns 'a' chr(65) returns 'A' Note that you are required to write recursive solution for this question (do not use loops). You may assume that all inputs are lower case letters only ('a' - 'z'). No additional library functions other than those mentioned above should be used by you. For example, do not import any library functions like count(), index(), etc., and do not use any built-in data structure like lists, arrays or dictionaries etc., except strings which are immutable data types in python by default (you may use them as needed after conversion from/to list/string type). If there are multiple solutions with same complexity then analyze all possible solutions with respect to space complexity (do not consider time complexity for this question), and select the solution with minimum space complexity among them because space constraint will be one of the important constraints while evaluating your code during grading phase. Also note that your code will run on multiple test cases (<=10), so do not hardcode anything but follow the above mentioned guidelines while writing your code because it will be evaluated against multiple test cases on our end during grading phase",

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or sequence of words that reads the same backward as forward. For example, madam or nurses run. Ignore spaces and punctuation marks when checking for palindromes. Also write the pytest test cases to test the program. Hint: Use built-in methods to solve the problem. Note: Write both functions in the same file. Use separate functions for each question. Ensure that you call main() function at the end of your code and add docstrings to all your functions including main(). Do not use any imports in your code other than those already present in this file (pytest is allowed). Your solution must be generic enough such that it can pass any argument of different data types (string, list etc.) to test_palindrome() function and return True/False accordingly while maintaining readability and efficiency of your code (you should not just hard-code it). The solution must work for all kinds of inputs (like empty string, single character string etc.). The input list can contain ints, floats as well as strings but it cannot contain complex numbers or any other type which does not support equality comparison operator(==). The input list may also contain nested lists/tuples inside it but you do not have to consider them as valid inputs here since we are dealing with only one dimensional lists/tuples here. You may assume that all elements in an input list will be unique i.e., there will be no repeated elements inside an input list but it may contain duplicate elements inside nested lists/tuples if any present inside an outer list/tuple. Also note that you do not have to remove duplicates from an input list before processing it because we are dealing with one dimensional lists here which cannot have duplicates by definition (if there are duplicates then they will be converted into non-duplicate form automatically by python itself before being passed into our custom function). Note: Don't forget to include docstrings and comments wherever necessary while solving this question! We expect good quality documentation from you! Also ensure",

Return None if no such substring exists. You can assume that the string consists of lowercase English letters only. The length of the string is greater than or equal to k. You can also assume that there are no two consecutive repeated characters in the given string. For example, given \"abcbdbdbbdcdabd\" and 3, then longest substrings are \"bcbdbdbbdcd\" and \"abcbdbdbbdcd\", but not \"cbbd\". The answer should be the first one found from left to right in case multiple answers exist with same length. If there is no such substring, return None. If you have an optimized solution, please do share it on our Slack channel!\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Assume that input string would only have lower case alphabets as mentioned above in problem statement (i.e., no numbers or special characters). Also assume that input value of k will always be greater than 0 and less than 26 (as we have 26 alphabets). You need not check for these values explicitly as part of your solution code but you may do so while writing test cases for your code as part of your submission file as per convenience/requirement/preference (not mandatory though).
