Return true if it is a perfect square else false. If the input is not an integer then return false. The input given will be in the form of an integer data type value. For example, a value of 5 will be passed as 5 and not as 5.0 . A negative value should also be handled and return false for it.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   For example, 4 is a perfect square (2 * 2) while 8 is not (2 * 2 * 2). So, the output for 4 will be True and for 8 will be False .  Also write your own main() function to test this function by taking inputs from user and displaying outputs on screen. Note that you need to test all possible cases like negative numbers, positive non-perfect squares etc., so that you are convinced that your logic works perfectly fine with all possible inputs including edge cases like zero, negative numbers etc., Hint: You can use math module in python to find out whether or not a number is an integer or decimal by using functions floor() and ceil() respectively from math module . Refer here for more details on math module : https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html?highlight=math#module-math . Note that you have to import this module before using any of these functions by using import statement as shown below : import math After importing this module , you can directly use these functions by prefixing them with name of the module separated by dot operator as shown below : math . floor ( x ) where x can either be a number or an expression which evaluates to some numeric value . You can also use ceil() function available inside this same module in similar manner as explained above . Task: Write a python function which takes one argument representing number whose perfect square status has to checked and returns boolean values true or false based on whether given number is perfect square or not respectively . Also write your own main() function which tests this user defined function with different inputs including edge cases like zero , negative numbers etc., Additional info: Break the",
