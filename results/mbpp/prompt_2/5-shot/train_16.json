You can jump either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time. You are given an integer N denoting the total number of steps in the staircase. The function should return an integer denoting the number of ways to reach the top. Note that you can only jump from one step to another and cannot skip any step in between. For example, for N=3, there are 4 ways: {1,1,1}, {1,2}, {2,1} and {3}. Similarly for N=4 there are 7 ways: {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2 ,2}, {1 ,2 ,1 },{ 2 ,1 ,1 },{ 3 , 1 } and{ 1 ,3 } . Also note that you cannot jump backwards or skip more than one step at a time. So for example if N=5 then you can only take three jumps i.e., from 5th stair to 4th stair (as you cannot skip more than one stair at a time), then from 4th stair to 2nd stair and finally from 2nd stair to top of stairs (as you cannot jump backwards). Hence there is only one way in which this task can be accomplished i.e., by taking three jumps as mentioned above and therefore your function must return an answer of type int with value equal to one when called with argument 5 as input parameter. If no such path exists then your function should return 0 as answer instead. If your solution exceeds the time limit on test cases then it will fail with TLE error message shown on screen during evaluation so try solving it using recursion first but if that exceeds time limit too then use dynamic programming approach instead but don't forget memoization part which is very important otherwise your solution will fail with MLE error instead due to excessive memory usage during execution so make sure you are using memoization properly while writing dynamic programming based solutions otherwise they will fail with MLE error message shown on screen during evaluation due to excessive memory usage by your program during execution",
