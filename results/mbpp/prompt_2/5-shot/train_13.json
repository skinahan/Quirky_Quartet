If no values are present then return 0. If any of the value is not a number then ignore it and continue to add remaining numbers. Return None if all values are not a number. The length of tuple list will be always greater than or equal to 1. Return None if any one of the tuple element is empty or if it contains only one element which is also not a number. The input will always be a tuple list and never an integer value or empty tuple list or None type object. For example, ([1, 2, 'a', 3], [3, 4], [5, 6]) returns 15 where as ([1], ['a']) returns None and ([1], [2]) returns 3 as there is only one element in second tuple and it's an integer value so we need to add that to our result else return None for empty tuples or tuples with non-numeric elements only. Note: Don't use any inbuilt python functions like reduce() and sum(). You can use len() function to get the length of given tuple list but don't use other functions like min(), max(), count() etc., Also don't use any other data structures like dictionaries/lists/sets etc., except tuples otherwise you will get 0 score for this question even if your answer is correct because we have asked you not to use those functions/data structures and you have used them intentionally which we can see from your code once you submit your solution for evaluation so please be careful while writing your code as this question has negative marks also associated with it if you go wrong anywhere while solving this question so please take care while writing your code as this question has negative marks also associated with it if you go wrong anywhere while solving this question so please take care while writing your code as this question has negative marks also associated with it if you go wrong anywhere while solving this question so please take care while writing your code as this question has negative marks also associated with it if you go wrong anywhere while solving this problem so please take care while writing your code as this problem has negative",

If the second item is equal, then sort by first item. The original order should be maintained while sorting the tuples. Also, return the sorted list with only tuple values and not keys. The input is a list of tuples and an integer value n. If n is 0, then sort by first item of each tuple and if n is 1, then sort by second item of each tuple. If n is something else, then return the original input list as it is without any changes. For example if the input list is [(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)] and n = 0 or 1 or 2 ,then output should be [(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)]. But if the input list is [(1,-2), (3,-4), (-5,-6)] and n = 0 or 1 or 2 ,then output should be [(-5,-6), (1,-2) ,(3,-4)]. The output should always be a sorted list containing only tuple values without keys like [(1,-2) ,(3,-4)]. No additional comments and docstrings are needed for this question. Also note that you cannot use any built-in functions to solve this question other than sorting functions like sorted() which can take key as an argument to decide how to perform sorting based on custom logic provided by user instead of default comparison logic used in normal sorting functions like sort(). You can use such built-in functions but only after writing your own custom code which solves this question without using any built-in functions other than those which are allowed as per instructions provided above for this question otherwise it will lead to cheating because you will not learn how to solve this problem on your own instead you will just learn how to use someone else's code which solves this problem so it will not help you in interviews where interviewer asks similar questions but expects solution from scratch without using any built-in functions other than those mentioned above for this question because that's what interviews are all about - solving",
