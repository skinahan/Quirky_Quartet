The given array is non-empty and contains positive integers. The given integer k is always smaller than the length of the array. The array has only positive integers and negative integers, but no zeros. Return 0 if there are no positive numbers in the given array. Return -1 if there are no negative numbers in the given array. Return -2 if there are all zeros in the given array. For example, for inputArray = [2, 3, 5, 1, 6], k = 2 output should be 8 and for inputArray = [4, 2, -3, 1], k = 2 output should be 3. Note that we can take sub-arrays like [4], [4, 2] or [4, 2,-3]. But we cannot take sub-arrays like [4,-3] or [-3]. Also note that answer will always be non-negative as we have made sure that there are at least one positive number in inputArray by returning zero if all elements are negative or zero. So answer will never be less than zero. And answer can only be greater than zero when at least one element is positive in inputArray as we have made sure that all elements are non-zero by returning -2 when all elements are zero in inputArray . So answer can never be equal to zero as well because it must contain at least one element which is greater than zero since it contains at least one positive number (if not then it would have returned 0). And since each element value is between 1 and 100000 inclusive so maximum possible value of sum of any subarray can never exceed 100000 * 1000 which fits into an integer data type range for almost all programming languages including C++/Java/Python/C# etc., except JavaScript which has a safe integer limit up to 9007199254740991 (which means you may get wrong answers with JavaScript). So you don't need to worry about integer overflow with this problem even though you may get TLE error on some online judges due to inefficient solutions like brute force approach etc., You may also get T",
