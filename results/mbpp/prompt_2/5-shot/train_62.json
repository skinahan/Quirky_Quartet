For example, if the given list is [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], then the maximum number of consecutive ones is 2. The input list will be given as an integer array. If there are no ones in the input array then your function should return zero. The length of the input array is less than or equal to 10^6. You can assume that every element in the array is either 0 or 1 only. This problem can be solved by using Kadane's algorithm for finding sub-arrays with maximum sum in an array (but you should not use this method here). You can solve this problem by using simple loops and if-else statements only. Do not use any built-in functions/libraries for your main logic; you may use built-in functions/libraries to generate test cases only. Your code should not take more than 5 seconds to run on our machines; otherwise it will time out and fail one or more test cases (you will get a runtime error). If your code times out on any test case then you will get a runtime error message and score zero for that test case even if your output is correct for that test case! You have to pass all test cases in order to receive points for this task! Your score will be computed based on how many tests you have passed; so do not hardcode any specific values from sample outputs shown below! Note that we may add some hidden tests which are different from what is shown below! We may also add some additional public tests without changing existing public tests shown below! So make sure that your code passes all existing public tests before submission! Sample Input #1: [1] Sample Output #1: 1 Sample Input #2: [0] Sample Output #2: 0 Sample Input #3: [0, 0] Sample Output #3: 0 Sample Input #4: [0, 1] Sample Output #4: 1 Sample Input #5: [1, 0] Sample Output #5: 1 Answer : def max_consecutive(nums): count = max = current = nums[0",
