The function should return a list with the longest consecutive elements sequence. If two sequences have the same length, return the sequence whose leftmost element appears first in the input array. For example, [1,2,3,4] has a longest consecutive sequence of [1,2,3,4], so does [4,3,2,1], but [4,3,-2,-1] has one that is longer than both of them. You can modify the input array by using 'sorted' or 'sort'. For example: arr = sorted(arr) or arr.sort(). Note that you should not use any additional data structure (e.g., hash set). You can only modify the input array and use it as an auxiliary storage space. The time complexity must be O(n). The function prototype is def findLongestConseqSubseq(arr): where arr is an integer array and its length is at least 2. Do not read any input from stdin/console; your solution must run on our servers with only one thread and O(n) complexity where n is equal to len(arr). Do not print anything to stdout/console; your solution must run on our servers with only one thread and O(n) complexity where n is equal to len(arr). The output must be returned as a list of integers containing the longest consecutive subsequence in original order (order does matter). If there are multiple solutions for this problem then you may return any of those solutions as long as they are correct and follow all requirements mentioned above. Note that if you want to submit your solution without modifying input array then you can first copy input array into another auxiliary storage space (e.g., another array), modify it according to requirements mentioned above and then return it from your function without modifying original input array itself or using any other data structure such as hash set etc..

You have to print the number of ways. The output should be printed in a separate line. Assume that the answer will always fit in an integer. The dominoes can be placed either horizontally or vertically. The empty cells are represented by 'E' and filled cells are represented by 'F'. If n is odd, then print \"-1\" as no solution exists for odd value of n. Note that there could be more than one solution and any of them will be accepted. Also, if there is no solution, then just print \"0\". Refer the sample input and output for formatting specifications. All text in bold corresponds to input and rest corresponds to output. Your code should be able to convert the sample input into corresponding output without any extra hardcoding involved anywhere apart from initialisation (if required). Test your code thoroughly before submission! Note that online judge can't always catch corner cases, so try your best effort on test cases locally as well! In case you are getting TLE/MLE/RTE errors on online judge but not locally, try increasing stack size limit (ulimit -s) or heap memory limit (ulimit -v) on your local machine! Refer here for more details on ulimit command usage - https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ulimit.htm . Also note that time taken by your code should ideally not exceed 0.5 seconds for most test cases even after increasing stack size or heap memory limit! Also note that you don't need to submit anything other than this file (.py file). No other files are required at submission time unless specified otherwise! We have provided some starter code below which you can use while writing your own implementation using classes which we recommend since it's easier to debug compared to functions only implementation! However, feel free to write functions only implementation too if you wish so! We've also provided some test data which you can use while debugging locally but remember that those won't work on online judge due to constraints mentioned",
