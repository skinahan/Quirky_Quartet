So, here we are using logarithm property which states that log y^x=x*log y In this program, we are calculating square root of number by finding power of e with power as half of log value of number minus one . We have used log1p() method in order to get accurate results as it calculates natural logarithm value of number plus one which avoids loss in precision caused due to subtraction operation on very small numbers . For example , If we calculate natural logarithm value of 24 directly then result will be 3.17805",
