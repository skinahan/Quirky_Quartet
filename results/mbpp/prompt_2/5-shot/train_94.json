Return true if they are anagrams else return false. Note: An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word using all the original letters exactly once. E.g., 'heart' and 'earth' are anagrams. The order of letters doesn't matter in case of anagrams. E.g., 'python' and 'typhon' are also anagrams as they both contain all the letters from 'python'. You can assume that there won't be any spaces in the string and all characters will be lowercase characters only. Also, you don't have to worry about punctuations or numbers as there won't be any in input strings either. If both strings have same count for each character then only we can consider them as anagrams else not! For example: \"listen\" and \"silent\" are not considered as anagram because their count for letter 'e' is different (1 vs 2). Similarly, \"aabbcc\" and \"bbcca\" also aren't considered as anagarms because their count for letter 'a', letter 'b', letter c is different (2 vs 1). But \"aabbcc\", \"bbcca\", \"abccba\", etc., these strings are considered as validly formed words with same length but they aren't considered as validly formed words with same set of characters so we cannot consider them as validly formed words with same set of characters so we cannot consider them to be validly formed words with same set of characters so we cannot consider them to be validly formed words with same set of characters so we cannot consider them to be validly formed words with same set of characters so we cannot consider them to be validly formed words with same set of characters so we cannot consider them to be validly formed words with same set of characterse that there won't be any spaces in the string and all characters willbe lowercase charcters only .
