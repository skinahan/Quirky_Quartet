You can use only higher order functions like map, filter and reduce etc... Hint : Use lambda expression. The input will be a list of integers and output should be comma separated string of numbers which are divisible by 3 and 5 as mentioned above in this question. Note that there is no need to add square brackets around your output string since we have added them already in our test code template, so just print your result without square brackets i.e., print([output]). For example if your input is [10, 15, 30] then your output should be \"15\" because 15 is divisible by 3 and 5 but not 10 or 30 which are not divisible by both 3 and 5 at once hence they are excluded from result string. Similarly if you get an empty list as input then print \"Empty List\" as output without quotes because there is no number that satisfies our given condition in this case so we will print empty string as per requirement but no need to add square brackets around it since we have already added them in our test code template file so just print \"Empty List\" without square brackets as output i..e., print(\"Empty List\") instead of printing [] which means blank list but here we want to print Empty List so please note that carefully before submitting your solution because you may lose marks if you don't follow these instructions carefully or mistakenly submit wrong answer due to these small mistakes so please read carefully what's written here before submitting",
