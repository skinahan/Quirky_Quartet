Also, write your own unit tests for various cases and edge cases, if any, using pytest or unittest module and upload it along with the solution file on GitHub repository as well as submit it on HackerRank (in case you are solving this problem on HackerRank). The name of the file should be \u2018problem-4-tests\u2019 or \u2018problem-4-tests.py\u2019 or \u2018Problem4Tests\u2019 or \u2018Problem4Tests.py\u2019 or similar name that makes sense to you so that we can understand it easily, else solution will not be considered for evaluation! No additional comments and docstrings are needed in test file except of course docstring at start of file specifying what tests have been written by you for this problem! Also note that we won't be evaluating any other test files submitted by you apart from this one! So make sure that all your test cases are written in this one only! If you want us to evaluate any other test files then please mention their names at top of this problem's code file so that we can consider them while evaluating your submission! Test cases must cover at least following scenarios: Various possible inputs like empty list, list with single element which is an odd number, list with single element which is an even number etc., normal lists with mix of odd and even numbers etc., invalid input types like strings etc., lists containing zero as an element etc., lists containing negative numbers as elements etc., edge cases like large numbers (larger than sys.maxsize) may cause overflow errors so please keep such edge cases in mind while writing unit tests! Please see sample input/output given below for more clarity about what exactly needs to be tested here!
