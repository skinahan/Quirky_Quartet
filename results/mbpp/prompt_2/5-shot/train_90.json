The length of the list should be equal to n. The order of permutations is not important. For example, if n = 3 and k = 2, then {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 1}, {2, 3}, {3, 1} and {3, 2} are the only valid permutations where list is [1 ,2 ,3]. Return 0 if no such permutation exists or n and k are negative or out of bounds. Note that an empty list is considered a valid input with 0 elements in it. For example: if n=0 and k=0 then output should be 1 as there will be only one empty set {} which will have 0 elements in it but that's still a valid set/permutation with 0 elements in it. If n=0 and k!=0 then output should be 0 as there will no sets/permutations with 'k' elements in it when there are no elements (n==0) given to begin with; hence answer would be 0 since no such sets/permutations exist with 'k' elements when there are no actual elements (n==0). So your code should handle these two cases properly based on above explanation i.e., when input list is empty (n==0) then your code should return either 1 or 0 depending on whether value of 'k' passed to function was also zero or non-zero respectively as explained above in this paragraph; else when input list has at least one element (n>=1) then your code should work as explained next in this paragraph below i.e., first check if value of 'k' passed to function was negative or greater than 'n' i.e., either k<0 OR k>n; if so then you need to return 0 from your code because we know that answer would always be zero for these two conditions i.e., either k<0 OR k>n because we can't have any sets/permutations with negative number of elements OR we can't have any sets/permutations with more number of elements than actual number given i.",
