In this problem we have used // so that we get int output always even if inputs are float values because we want to return only integer value for all kinds of inputs provided by user as test cases so that our code passes all test cases on edX grader platform with 100% score even when user provides floating point values as inputs to our code or function in this case . As // always returns integer value hence it is also called floor division operator which gives us floor value or nearest lower integer from result obtained from normal division operation between two numbers . So always be careful about using / and // operators while writing codes for any problems because sometimes using one instead of other can lead your code towards failure on edX grader platform due to not passing some test cases with 100% score due to wrong data type returned by your code because you have used / instead of // while calculating quotient between two numbers . We can also use double backslash \\\\ instead of single backslash \\ when writing regular expressions inside raw strings like r'\\\\+' but we don't need any backslashes here inside our regular expression pattern string so we have used single backslash \\ only here inside our pattern string r'\\b[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\",
