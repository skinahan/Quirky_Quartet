The numbers are in range 1, 2, ... , n. One number is missing from the list. The input array has no duplicates and contains only one missing element. The length of the input array can be any integer greater than 0 and less than 100000. Example: [1, 2, 4] should give you 3 as output, [4, 7, 3, 5] should give you 6 as output and so on... You can assume that all inputs are valid arrays containing integers only with no duplicates and one missing element. Do not use any built-in functions or methods to solve this question. You may use helper functions but do not modify the signature of the given function or add any additional parameters to it. You may create additional classes/functions if required but do not modify existing ones or create global variables/objects/lists etc., unless explicitly asked to do so in the question statement itself. All such modifications will lead to automatic disqualification of your submission for this contest without further notice. Your code will be run against multiple test cases by our automated evaluation system after time limit is over for this contest and will be evaluated based on correctness and efficiency of your solution against all test cases passed by our evaluation system among all submissions received within time limit for this contest from different participants like you across globe who have attempted this question during contest period as well as after end of contest period till such date when winners are announced publicly by us for this contest unless otherwise specified by us in writing at our sole discretion before start of such evaluation process or before announcement of winners respectively whichever comes first at our sole discretion without any further notice to you or other participants like you across globe who have attempted this question during contest period as well as after end of contest period till such date when winners are announced publicly by us for this contest unless otherwise specified by us in writing at our sole discretion before start of such evaluation process or before announcement of winners respectively whichever comes first at our sole discretion without any further notice to you or other participants like you across globe who have",
