You can use standard American denominations, that is, 1\u00a2, 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, and 25\u00a2. For example, given n = 16, return 3 since we can make it with a 10\u00a2, a 5\u00a2 and a 1\u00a2. Also write the function to find the minimum number of coins required to make n cents using a bottom-up approach. Also write the function to find the minimum number of coins required to make n cents using dynamic programming approach. The same question could be asked for any currency system. Generalize your function so that it works for any set of denominations as input argument. Use memoization technique in order to optimize your solution with recursion approach. Also write the unit tests for all three functions with different test cases.\"\"\"</code>\n\n\n\n",

You can climb the staircase starting from any step. For example, for n = 4 steps there are 5 different ways to climb the stairs. They are (1-1-1-1), (2-1-1), (2-2), (3-1) and (4). The output should be a list of tuples containing different ways to reach the top of the staircase from bottom. For example, for n = 4 output should be [(1, 1, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1), (2, 2), (3 ,1)]. Order does not matter while returning tuples. So [(3 ,1)] is same as [(1 ,3)]. Sort the returned list in ascending order based on length of each tuple and then by value of each tuple element in ascending order. If there are multiple tuples with equal length then sort them by their values in ascending order. For example [(2 ,2) ,(3 ,1)] is sorted list for input n = 4 while [(2 ,2) ,(1 ,3)] is not sorted list for input n = 4 because it does not follow above mentioned sorting criteria. If there are no possible ways to climb then return an empty list []. If any argument passed other than positive integer returns None object. Note: Do not use library functions or builtin methods like power or factorial etc.. Use recursion only to solve this problem and try using dynamic programming approach by using memoization technique as well which will enhance your problem solving skill . Also write recursive solution without using memoization technique also . You may assume that n will be less than 250 . See question video for more details about what is memoization technique . Hint : Number of ways to reach ith step is equal to sum of number of ways reaching previous steps + current step .
