If it is palindrome it should return true otherwise false. If the string length is less than 3 then it should return true. Note that you need to write this functionality in one line of code. The function name should be check_palindrome. Note that you are not allowed to use any other python built-in functions for this question except len(). Also, do not use any inbuilt methods/functions for string handling like replace(), upper(), lower() etc. You can use simple if statements and while loop only once each in the solution. You can also use str[::-1] to reverse a string but only as a part of your solution, i.e., you cannot directly reverse the given string using str[::-1] and then compare with original input string since that would fail some test cases where there are duplicates in the input string which would get reversed too along with actual characters when you do str[::-1]. You can also use list slicing [start:end:step], but again only as a part of your solution, i.e., you cannot directly create another list from original input list using list slicing [start:end:step] and then compare with original input list since that would fail some test cases where there are duplicates in the input list which would get reversed too along with actual elements when you do slicing [start:end:-1]. For more details about Python strings and lists refer python documentation at https://docs.python.org/3/. For more details about Python builtin functions refer https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions . Also, note that we will evaluate your code on python version 3 (specifically on version 3 .7). So make sure your code works on python version 3 or greater than version 3 .7 before submitting it for evaluation by clicking \"Submit Answer\" button below this question's description (not above). If your code fails on our evaluation environment due to compatibility issues with newer versions of Python then it will be marked as incorrect even if it passes all test cases locally when executed on older versions of Python (version 2 or less than version 3 ).",
