It will not run as you expect it to. You should write your code in the <code>main</code> function. You can also use the <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code>. This will help you run your code from a terminal or command line. Here is an example of how to use it. It will also help you when you want to import your code into another file and use it as a module. Here is an example of how to do that too. The second example also uses the main function and if __name__ == '__main__' statement too.  Also, if you are using python3 then put parentheses around your print statements like this: <code>(print('Hello World'))</code>. It's not necessary in python2 but it's good practice for both versions of python so that when you switch from one version to another, things don't break for no reason because of something silly like missing parentheses around print statements.  In addition, I would recommend putting all of your imports at the top of your file so that they are easy to find and easy to edit later on if needed. Also, I would recommend using docstrings in all functions so that they are easier for other people (and yourself) to understand what each function does later on down the road when someone needs to change something or fix something or add something new because they didn't know what each function did without looking through lots of code trying to figure out what everything does which could take hours or even days sometimes depending on how big a project is and how many functions there are etc... Docstrings are just comments at the beginning of every function (and class etc...) that explain what each thing does etc... Here is an example:  https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/python-docstrings . Another thing I would recommend doing with docstrings is putting them before every class and module (file) too so that people can easily see what everything does without having to look through lots of lines of code just trying to figure out what everything does which could take hours sometimes depending",
