No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nBreak the problem down into smaller pieces. Sorting the input might help you create an efficient solution, use vectorised operations when possible. Apply recursion where possible.\nAnswer:",

The above line will give you a list of all even numbers from 1 to <code>n</code>. Then you can use <code>sum()</code> function on that list and divide it by its length using <code>len()</code>.
