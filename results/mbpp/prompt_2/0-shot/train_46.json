For more info on this refer here \u2013 user12299427 yesterday Edit 2 Thanks @WillemVanOnsem for pointing out that <code>(?=[A-Z])</code> is not working properly when there are consecutive uppercase letters or lowercase letters like <code>'HELLO WORLD'</code>,<code>'hello world'</code>. So I added some extra lines of code so that it will take care of both cases with spaces or without spaces between words \u2013 user12299427 yesterday Edit 3 The following solution also works when there are consecutive uppercase",
