The second solution has too much boilerplate code (<code>sum()</code>, <code>range()</code>, <code>[x**5 for x in ...]</code>) that can be replaced with one single line of code <code>(n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6</code>.

The first solution also does not require any external dependencies or tools such as Python interpreter or Jupyter Notebook which makes it easier to run on many platforms without installing anything else but Python itself.  In addition, if you have no idea how to solve this task then you have no choice but using brute force method like in the second solution which would make me think that you do not understand what exactly this task requires from you and how to implement it efficiently without making any assumptions about input data type or structure of output data type etc...  \n\n",
