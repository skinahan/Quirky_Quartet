It uses recursion: it calls <code>is_no_profit</code> twice, once for each of the two possible ways to divide the input into two parts. If either of those calls returns <code>True</code>, then so does this call (and we can stop calling it recursively). Otherwise, we return <code>False</code>.  This is a simple example of dynamic programming (if you don't know what that means, don't worry about it). The time complexity is O(n^2), and the space complexity is O(n). The first time this function is called with a given value of n, it will take O(n^2) time to compute; but once that's done, subsequent calls with the same value of n will take only O(1) time.  Here's some code:  (I'm assuming Python 3.)  \n<code>def is_no_profit (n):\n\n    if n == 1:                                 # Base case 1 -- trivial case.\n\n        return True\n\n    if memo [n] != -1:                         # Base case 2 -- already computed?\n\n        return memo [n]                        # If so, just use memoized answer.\n\n    memo [n] = False                           # Not yet computed? Initialize to False...\n\n    for i in range (1, n // 2 + 1):            # ...try dividing into two parts...\n\n        if is_no_profit (i) and is_no_profit (n - i):   # ...if both halves are no-profits...    \n\n            memo [n] = True                    # ...then so is the whole thing!    \n\n            break                              # And we're done searching for an i!    \n\n    return memo [n]                            # Return whichever way we got here!    \n</code>\nYou'll need to declare and initialize a global array called <code>memo</code>, like this:  \n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://",
