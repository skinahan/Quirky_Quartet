It could also help you pass some test cases faster since some test cases may have large data sets and you're timed for each test case separately so you want to pass them as fast as possible, even though your overall performance won't matter for getting credit on this question.   Finally, sorting helps us take advantage of vectorised operations since we can compare adjacent elements when iterating over our sorted list instead of having to compare every element with every other element (O(n^2)).
