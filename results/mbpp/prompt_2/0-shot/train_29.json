You need to return a set of tuples.  A set is more appropriate because order doesn't matter and you don't want duplicates.  Also the list should be sorted in some way to make it easier for the user to test against.  I recommend sorting by distance from the center tuple followed by clockwise rotation starting at 12 o'clock.  For example if you had a tuple <code>(0, 0)</code>, your function would return: <code>{(-1,-2), (-2,-1), (-2,0), (-2, 1)}</code>.   The distance from the center is 2 for all of them so they are sorted in clockwise order starting at 12 o'clock and going counterclockwise.  \n",
