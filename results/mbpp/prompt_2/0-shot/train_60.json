The idea is that you want to build up a list of sums, where each element in the list corresponds to the maximum sum ending at that point (so if your original list was <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, then your sum list would be <code>[1, 3, 6]</code>).  That way when you get to the end of your list and have to decide whether or not it's better for your answer to skip the last element or not (because skipping the last element means you can't skip both the last and second-to-last elements), all of the work has already been done for you.  This is called memoization.  Here's an implementation:\n<code>def maxSumNoThreeConsecutiveElements(lst):\n\n    # Initialize our memoization table with -infinity at every index so we know which ones we've visited yet and which ones we haven't.\n\n    sums = [-float(\"inf\")] * len(lst)\n\n    # Calculate our first two values because they're special cases.\n\n    sums[0] = lst[0] # We'll always include this one since there's no other choice.\n\n    if len(lst) &gt; 1: # If there are two or more elements...\n\n        sums[1] = lst[0] + lst[1] # We'll always include this one too because it doesn't allow us to skip any elements later on (we don't want consecutive skips).\n\n        if len(lst) &gt; 2: # If there are three or more elements...\n\n            sums[2] = max([sums[0], lst[1], lst[2]]) + lst[2] # We'll either include this one and skip everything before it",
