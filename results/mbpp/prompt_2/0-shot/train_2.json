That single digit must be the same as the original number.\n\n    For example, 81 is a lucid number because 8**2 + 1**2 = 64 + 1 = 65, which is not equal to 81. Therefore, 81 is not a valid answer but 9 and 25 are both valid answers because 9**2 = 81 and 2**2 + 5**2 = 4 + 25 = 29 and 29 == 25.\n\n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The upper bound for the search.

We can't just use \"return 0\" here because that wouldn't work properly with inputs of 0 since they'd be returned as Falsey values instead of Truey ones (i.e., they'd evaluate as \"False\" rather than \"True\"). Using \"return min(n,0)\" would solve this issue but I think it's more efficient/cleaner/easier-to-read/etc... in this case just to use two separate conditional statements instead of one combined one like that since we only need two different outcomes anyway! :)\n\n    def check_if_lucid(number):  # Check whether a given integer value is a valid solution by seeing whether its digits sum together properly when squared...\n        str_num = str(number)  # Convert our",
