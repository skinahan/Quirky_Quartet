I don't think it's necessary to break the problem down into smaller pieces.  I think it's a simple calculation and there is no need for recursion.  I don't see how sorting the input would help create an efficient solution or how vectorised operations are applicable here.   It seems to me that you are over-complicating this task and making it more difficult than necessary.   In my opinion your code does not answer the question because it does not find the largest possible value of k such that k modulo x is y.    That said, your code will pass all of the tests in HackerRank so you can submit it as your answer and get full credit for it if you want to do so...but I'm curious why you posted this question in Code Review instead of Stack Overflow or Stack Exchange?  If you're looking for criticism on style or performance then maybe Code Review is appropriate but otherwise it seems like an odd choice.  Also, what language did they say they wanted you to use? Your code looks like Python but they didn't specify a language and there are several other languages available on HackerRank including C++, Java and Ruby...and some others too...so which one did they want you to use?     Finally, if this really was an interview question then why would anyone post their answer publicly?  Wouldn't that give away the answer for future job candidates? Would any employer really ask someone to do this during an interview anyway?
