Two lists, a and b can be circularly identical if appendin list b to itself any number of times will result in list a. For example: [10, 10, 0, 0, 10] and [10, 10, 10, 0, 0] are circularly identical but [1 ,10, 10, 0] and [10 ,10 ,0 ,1] are not. Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.

Sorting the input might help you create an efficient solution; use vectorised operations when possible; apply recursion where possible.

In other words, if the user enters 5, your program should print out 120 because 5*4*3*2*1 equals 120. What happens if you enter a negative number? What about 0? You don\u2019t have to deal with these cases for this exercise; just think about them for yourself! (Hint: remember that integers can be negative.) You will need to use at least one loop in your solution. (Hint 2: you can use either while or for loops.) You may assume that the user always enters an integer greater than or equal to 1 when prompted by your program. (If they do not, then they will see an error message in response.) Your program should not crash if the user enters something silly like \u201ca\u201d instead of an integer \u2013 it should simply tell them that they did not enter a valid integer and ask again until they do so correctly! Hint 3: you can use try-except blocks here as well if you want to be extra careful!
