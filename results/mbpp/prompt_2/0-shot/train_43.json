We want to swap elements only if there are at least 2 elements remaining in the array after 'start' (because we need 2 elements to swap). If there are less than 2 elements remaining, then swapping will not have any effect on those 1 or 0 elements that are left after 'start'. So we stop when there are less than 2 elements remaining after 'start'. We do this by running a loop while 'start' is less than 'end'. This way we make sure that at least two elements will be left in the array after start before swapping them. Otherwise we will get error if we try to access element at index greater than length of array. For example if length of array is 5 and we run our loop till index 3 (which is 4), then when we try to access arr[4] which doesn't exist because length of arr is 5 and last element's index will be 4 only as first element has index 0 and so on...

Always check if you're accessing values within bounds i.e., within range [0, len(arr)-1] where len(arr) returns number of items present in arr; also note that len() returns 1 more than last valid index so it's better practice not use len() directly but instead use len()-1 which gives last valid index because last valid index = (len() - 1) and this expression gives exactly what you want i.e., last valid index!
