Also note that range() function doesn't include the last value in its output, so we add 1 after taking square root of n and taking floor of it so that we include sqrt(n) in range(). For example when n = 9 then sqrt(9) = 3 and int(3) = 3 but range(2,3+1) only returns [2] as output because range doesn't include the last value (in this case 4). So if we don't add 1 then our loop would only run till i=2 and not till i=3 which would be wrong as 9 is divisible by both 2 and 3 (and hence not a prime number). We can also use xrange instead of using range here because xrange outputs an iterator instead of generating all values at once (like how list does), but I prefer using range here because I think it's easier to read/understand than xrange function. But if you want your code to run faster you can use xrange instead of using range here because xrange will save memory by generating each value on demand while iterating over them whereas range will generate all values at once before iteration starts (which will take up more memory).
