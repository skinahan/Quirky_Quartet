How do I do it?\n\n\nA:\n\nThe problem with your code is that you are not using recursion.  You are instead using a list comprehension to filter out elements of the input list.  That's fine and dandy but doesn't fit the requirements of the task (as you've noted).  Instead of iterating over the list and filtering elements out, you need to break down the problem into smaller pieces by calling your function recursively on sublists of your input.  This can be done as follows:\n<code>def count_in_range(input_list, minimum, maximum):\n\n    # Base case 1: empty list -&gt; return 0 elements in range\n    if len(input_list) == 0: return 0\n\n    # Base case 2: single element -&gt; check if it's in range and return 1 or 0 accordingly.  \n    elif len(input_list) == 1: return (1 if minimum &lt;= input[0] &lt;= maximum else 0)\n\n    else: # Recursive case -&gt; call count on left half and right half of list and add together to get final result.  \n\n        mid = len(input) // 2 # note this uses integer division so will truncate any remainder when dividing odd numbers.  \n\n        left = countInRange(input[0 : mid], min, max) # note that this will include index mid but not index mid + 1 since slicing is exclusive on right hand side.  \n\n        right = countInRange(input[mid + 1 : ], min, max) # note that this will exclude index mid but include index len(input)-1 since slicing is inclusive on left hand side.  \n\n        return left + right  # add together results from recursive calls on two halves of input list to get final answer for full list!  \n</code>\n",
