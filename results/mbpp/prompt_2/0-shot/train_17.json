If there is no repeated character then return None.  For example if the input string is \u201ctutorialcup\u201d then output should be \u2018o\u2019 and if input string is \u201ccodefight\u201d then output should be None.   The input to the function will be a python list and the output should be an integer which is index of first repeated element.  If there are multiple such elements, you need to return index of any one of them.   Indexing starts with 0.   No additional comments and docstrings are needed.  Your code will be auto graded by our system based on certain test cases we have created for this question so do not hardcode for any fixed set of values as it might result in zero marks for this question .   For example :- Input : ['t','o','p','c','o','d','e','r'] Output : 1 Input : ['c', 'u', 'p'] Output : -1 Input: ['z', 'e', 'b', 'r', 'a'] Output: 3 Additional Info: Break down your solution into smaller pieces, try using recursion where possible, use vectorized operations when possible instead of loops as they are faster than loops in python Use helper functions where possible Try writing your own test cases apart from ones we have provided for you Try solving problems similar to this one before attempting it again . \"\"\"\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\" Question: Write a function that takes two lists l1 and l2 as arguments and returns True if they have at least 3 common members or False otherwise .
