It would be nice to have some comments on what you're doing at each step, but at least a docstring would help a lot. The code also doesn't really follow PEP8 conventions; variable names should be <code>snake_case</code>, and there should be spaces after commas (e.g., <code>for i in range(0, len(input))</code>).  It's also good practice to use <code>if __name__ == '__main__'</code>, so your code can be imported without running it automatically.
