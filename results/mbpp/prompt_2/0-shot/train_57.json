We could use argmax() here but this is slower than using max() and comparing to each element individually because argmax() needs to find all elements that are equal to max() which means it has to iterate through all elements even if they are not equal to max().  By using max(), we can break out of the loop when we find a value larger than our current max value so it's much faster for larger arrays (>1000 elements).  For small arrays (<10), argmax() is faster because it uses built-in numpy functions which are faster than for loops but for large arrays, for loops are quicker because they don't have to do any extra work checking if there are multiple identical values like argmax() does.  If you know there will only be one or two values that occur most often (i.e., no ties), then you can use argmax().
