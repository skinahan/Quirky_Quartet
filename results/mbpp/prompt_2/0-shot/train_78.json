Note that even though lists are iterable, they are mutable so when slicing them you must use [x:] syntax instead of (x:) syntax which would otherwise cause an error message like \"TypeError: 'list' object does not support item assignment\". Also note that you can use negative indices for lists like [-1] or [-2:] but you can't do this with tuples because they are immutable so trying something like (-1) on a tuple will give you an error message saying \"TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\" whereas trying something similar on a list will work just fine and give you whatever element is last in your list or whatever elements are last two elements in your list depending on whether you're using [-1] or [-2:] respectively. In fact lists and tuples have many differences between them including their mutability/immutability, their slicing behaviour and also their support for methods like .append() which only works with lists but not with tuples since they're immutable while lists are mutable so appending new items onto them is possible while appending new items onto immutable objects like tuples isn't possible because once created tuples cannot be changed",
