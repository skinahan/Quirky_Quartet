Find whether any anagram of string s can be a palindrome after at most K removals from it. If yes print YES otherwise print NO. Anagrams are formed by rearranging all characters in a word or phrase to create a new word or phrase using all original letters exactly once each; e.g., \"top\" is an anagram of \"pot\". A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward; e.g., \"madam\". For example, given s = \u201cabcd\u201d and K = 2 you can remove 2 characters from s so that \u201cab\u201d remains which is an anagram of \u201cba\u201d which is also a palindrome so we print YES because there exists at least one valid way to make our string into a palindrome after at most K removals from it (removing both c and d). Another example would be given s = \u201cabcda\u201d and K = 3 you can remove 3 characters from s so that \u201ca\u201d remains which is not only an anagram but also a palindrome as well so we print YES because there exists at least one valid way to make our string into a palindrome after at most K removals from it (removing b, c",
