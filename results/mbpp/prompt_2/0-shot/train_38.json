You can reuse numbers from the list and you can assume that there is always exactly one solution. For example, given [5, 7, 1, 3] and 10 you should return True (because 5 + 5 = 10). You may assume that numbers in the input list are unique (i.e., no duplicates). Do not use any built-in python functions such as sort or sorted etc., in your solution. Note that this problem is different than finding two elements whose sum is equal to some target value in an array; here we have only one array and we have to find two elements from it whose sums equal our target value! Also note that your solution should be efficient; do not use nested loops! Hint: Think about which data structure would be most useful for solving this problem efficiently? Answer: The code below uses hash tables (i.e., dictionaries), which are extremely fast when searching for values based on keys (in this case we are looking for keys based on values). We iterate through each element in our input array once only and look up each element's complement in our hash table using O(1) time complexity operations; therefore our algorithm runs at O(n) time complexity overall! def findSumExistsInListOfIntegersUsingHashTableMethod(inputListOfIntegers=[5, 7, 1, 3],targetNumber=10): myDict = {} for i in range (0 , len(inputListOfIntegers)-1): myDict[inputListOfIntegers[i]] = i complement = targetNumber - inputListOfIntegers[i] if complement >= 0",

You should try to use a list comprehension where possible, especially when you can translate it into a simple one-liner. You could also use <code>str.istitle</code>, which checks whether the first letter of a string is uppercase and the rest are lowercase letters: <code>[name for name in names if name.istitle()]</code>. There's no need to call <code>sum</code>, since you can just add all the lengths together inside of the list comprehension: <code>[len(name) for name in names if name[0].isupper()]</code>.  The only other thing I would change is that you should give your function a more descriptive name, like <code>sum_lengths_of_uppercase_names</code>. For readability, I would also add some spaces around operators and after commas, as well as putting parentheses around each expression inside of your list comprehensions: \n\n",
