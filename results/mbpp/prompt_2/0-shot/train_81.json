The power set is all possible combinations of the list items. For example if the input is [1,2] then the output should be [[], [1], [2], [1, 2]]. The order of the sets in the output does not matter. The input list will not be empty and it will only contain unique integers. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nBreak the problem down into smaller pieces. Sorting the input might help you create an efficient solution, use vectorised operations when possible. Apply recursion where possible.\nAnswer:\ndef powerset(l):     # l is an array of numbers (integers)\n    if len(l) == 1:  # base case - when we get down to 1 element in array we just return that element as an array and its empty set as a subarray within that array - this is our base case for recursion - once we get to one element in our original array we can't go any further down so we need to start working back up with our recursive calls adding one more element each time until we have worked through all elements in original array and added them all into every possible combination (subset) within our final powerset/resulting arrays - this is how recursion works - it breaks things down into their simplest form (base case) then works back up recombining things as it goes until it gets back to original state but now with additional stuff done/added at each step along way!  So here at base case with just one element left in original array l = [4] we return [[],[4]] because 4 has no other elements to combine with so its empty set must be returned alongside itself as an array!   This base case result of [[],[4]] will be used by recursive call below as part of its result which gets built up gradually by adding one more element from original input l each time until all elements have been considered!   So next time round when l =[3,4] first recursive call will break l down into two lists both containing single elements ie [[3],[4]]  Then for second recursive call these two lists are combined together ie [[],[3],[4],[3,4]]  Now third recursive call has three",
