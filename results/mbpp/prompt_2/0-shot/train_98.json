We can perform a swap by flipping two bits in either string (e.g., changing \"101\" -&gt; \"111\"). If we flip two bits and they are different, then we reduce our overall difference count by 2 (because we changed 2 bits). If they are the same then we increase our overall difference count by 2 (because we changed 0 bits). In either case, after flipping two bits there are at most 2 fewer differences between the strings than there were before the swap. Thus, if there were n differences before any swap then after at most n/2 swaps there will be at most 2 differences left between them and so only 1 more swap is required to finish converting one string into another (this final 1-swap step is guaranteed because both strings have equal length).\n\n    # To find a good pair of indices for swapping, let's find a pair of indices where one bit is different in each string and both those bits are equal in the other string: these would be ideal indices for swapping because after swapping their values they would both become identical and thus cancel out as a difference between the strings. Let's try all possible pairs of indices until we find such an ideal pair or until we've tried all possible pairs without finding any ideal pairs (in which case no such pair exists). Let's also keep track of how many times each index occurs in an ideal pair so that when choosing which pair to use for swapping next time around, we can give priority to those indices which appear less often as part of an ideal pair since this means that swapping them will lead us closer to having no more differences left between our strings sooner rather than later (and thus require fewer total swaps",
