I would like to suggest one more way to do the same thing. You can use list comprehension with <code>isinstance</code> function to check whether the element is an integer or not as shown below:  (I have added some more test cases as well.)  \n<code>def find_even(mixed_list):\n\n    return [x for x in mixed_list if isinstance(x, int) and x%2==0]  # list comprehension method\n\n    #return filter(lambda x : True if (isinstance(x,int) and x%2==0) else False ,mixed_list)   # filter method can also be used. It will give a generator object instead of a list. So you need to convert it into a list using `list()` function as shown below  . \n\n     ##return list((filter(lambda x : True if (isinstance(x,int) and x%2==0) else False ,mixed_list)))   # If you want to use this method then uncomment this line and comment the previous line above it. This will give you the same output as above but will be slower than the first method listed above since it requires extra step of converting generator object into a list using `list()` function which takes extra time. \n\n     ##return [x for x in mixed_list if type(x) == int and x%2==0]   # This also works but you should use `isinstance` instead of `type` since it's faster than `type`. Uncomment this line only when you want to compare both methods side by side . Otherwise don't uncomment this line . It has been commented out just for comparison purpose only .
