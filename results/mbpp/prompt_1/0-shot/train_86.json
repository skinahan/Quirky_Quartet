Because you want an integer.  So you can use <code>return gcd(a // b, b)</code>. This will make sure that the result is always an integer. Otherwise for example if you have to find the GCD of 9 and 6. It will give you 3 as the answer. But in this case it will give 1 as the answer because 9/6 is equal to 1.5 which is not an integer. So by using <code>//</code>, it will always give an integer result and your answer would be correct.  In python3 we have both <code>/</code>(for floating point division) and <code>//</code>(for floor division). So we don't need to worry about that anymore but in python2 we only have one operator for division which results in decimal number even if both numbers are integers .

But I'll try to explain what's wrong with your code anyway - maybe it will help you understand what recursion is better. Also I'll show how you can fix it to get the right answer using recursion. You can also read about Euclidean algorithm on Wikipedia or watch some videos on YouTube (for example this one) to understand how it works and why your code doesn't work as expected.   So let's start!   First of all, here's how <code>gcd</code> function should work according to its description:   <blockquote>Write a function to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers by using recursion.</blockquote> The important thing here is that we have two integers and we need to find their greatest common divisor (gcd). It means that our function should take two arguments - two integers - and return one integer which will be their gcd. Here's an example of how you can use such function in Python (I'll call my version of <code>gcd</code> <code>my_gcd</code>, so that I don't override yours):   <blockquote><pre><b>>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_gcd(24, 36)</b><br/>12<br/><b>>&gt;&gt;&gt; my_gcd(3125, 7981)</b><br/>125<br/></pre></blockquote> As you see from these examples, when called with different integers as arguments our function returns correct result each time - which means that it works correctly!
