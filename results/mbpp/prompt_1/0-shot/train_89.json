So, something like this:  \n<code>from functools import reduce   # python 3 only; use `__future__` for python 2 support \nfrom operator import mul       # multiply two numbers together to get a new number \n\n                               # take a list of numbers, and reduce it down to a single number  by multiplying the current value with the next item in the list (e.g., [1,2,3] -&gt; 1 * 2 * 3)  \n\n                               # [1,2,3] is equivalent to (((1*2)*3)) ) ) ) ) ...  \n\n                               # reduce takes three arguments: A function that takes two arguments (two items from your iterable), an iterable (a list) and an optional initializer (what you want to start off with).   The initializer is optional because if your iterable was not empty we would have started off with `l[0]` as our accumulator and then multiplied by `l[1]`, etc...     If you don't pass an initializer then it will use the first item in your iterable as the starting point instead of using whatever you provide as an initial value.   So be careful when using this function!     For example: if you pass an empty list into reduce(), then it will raise a TypeError because there is no starting point which can be used as an accumulator for multiplying things together!     Also note that if you pass in a non-empty iterable but also provide an initializer, then it will use whatever you provided as the starting point instead of using the first item from your iterable!    This is why I usually always provide one even if I don't think I need one because I'm paranoid about getting unexpected results due to my own stupidity or assumptions ... :P      Another thing to note is that this function does not modify your original data",
