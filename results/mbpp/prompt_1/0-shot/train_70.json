I will explain it in C. \nFirst, let's look at the binary representation of <code>n</code>. For example, if <code>n = 12</code>, then its binary is <code>1100</code>. Now we want to set the rightmost unset bit. So we first need to find out which bit is unset. We can do that by using this formula: <code>-x = ~x + 1</code>. So if we take the negative of n, then all bits are inverted except for the rightmost 0 (because it has no effect on the result). For example, if <code>-12 = -1100 = 0011 + 1 = 0100</code>, which means that only bit 3 was inverted and all other bits were not affected because they were already 0s. \nNow we can simply find out which bit was not affected by taking an AND operation between n and -n. For example: <code>(12 &amp; -12) = 1100 &amp; 0100 = 0100</code>. This means that only bit 2 was not affected by inverting all bits except for rightmost 0 in n. \nFinally, we just need to OR this value with n to get our result (<code>(12 | 4) = 1100 | 0100 = 1100 + 0100 = 1101</code>) and voila! We have set our right most unset bit! :) \n",
