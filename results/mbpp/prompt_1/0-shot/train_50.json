Answer 2 : longest_word() function : This functions finds the length of the longest word in a sentence. To do so, it splits this sentence into words using string method split(), then stores these words into an array called \"words\". Then it checks for each word its length using len(), compares each new length with current maximum length, and updates maximum length if necessary. So this functions takes 1 string parameter representing a sentence and returns an integer representing its maximum word's size. The complexity of this function is O(n) where n = len(sentence). This functions uses two loops (one for splitting into words, one for checking lengths), so it's linear complexity too (the worst case scenario would be that every character represents a different word).",
