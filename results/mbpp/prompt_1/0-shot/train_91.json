The logic can be implemented using a loop that iterates over all numbers from 1 to n, where n is the input number. In each iteration, we need to multiply the current iteration value by previous value in order to find out factorial. We also need to store all intermediate values in a list in order to calculate last two digits later on.\n2) Find out last two digits of factorial calculated above. We need another loop that iterates over all elements stored in list and adds them up one by one and then modulo 100 is performed on result at each iteration so that only last two digits are preserved at each step before adding next element from list. Once we have found this final result, we print it as output for this question\n\n\nQuestion: \nWrite a python function which takes a string as an argument and returns first non-repeated character in it? If there are no non-repeated characters return None? \n\n  Note: This function should ignore case sensitivity i.e if string contains \u201cA\u201d or \u201ca\u201d return either one i.e either A or a? Task: Write a python function to solve the above question No additional comments and docstrings are needed? Additional info: Which data structure is being used? Can the task be split into smaller sub-tasks? How many loops are needed to solve tasks? Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find answer Answer: In this question, we will take an input string from user and return first non repeated character in string along with its index position if it exists else None will be returned back The data structure used here is dictionary which stores count of characters present in input string The task can be split into smaller subtasks as follows 1) Read input string 2) Check if any character occurs more than once 3) If yes then print first such character with its index position 4) Else print None Answer code also has comments for explaining steps mentioned above Question: Write a python program which takes an integer N (N>0) as an argument and returns sum of integers from 1 till N without using any arithmetic operators (+,-,*,/,%,// etc)?
