The docstring should explain what the function does and what it returns.  It should also explain how to use the function.  If there are any restrictions on the arguments, you should say so in the docstring.  A good example of a docstring would be:\n<code>def remove_kth(l, k):\n    \"\"\"Remove the k-th element of list l and return it.\"\"\"\n\n    # ... rest of your code ...\n\n    return result # or None if you want to modify `l` in place instead of returning anything.  See below for more info about this choice.\n</code>\n\n\nYou can improve your code by using <code>del</code>.   <code>del l[k]</code> removes element <code>k</code>, while <code>l = [i for i in range(len(l)) if i != k]</code>, creates a new list without that element which is less efficient than just deleting it from the original list (especially if you are doing this multiple times on large lists).   However, note that <code>del l[k]</code>, modifies <code>l</code>.  If you don't want to modify <code>l</code>, then use a slice to create a new list without that element:   <blockquote><pre><b><i>>&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [1,2,3,4]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; del l[0]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(l)<br/></i></b>[2, 3, 4]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; new_list = [1,2,3][:-1]+[1,2][1:]<br/> &lt;-- equivalent to `new_list = [1,2][:-1]+[3][1:]` or `new_list = [2]+[3]` which is equivalent to `new_list = [2]+[]+[3]`, which gives us `new_list == [2 , 3 ]`.<br/></pre></",
