You need to submit your python file for grading this task (it should contain only one function). This task will be graded based on your code quality, comments, docstrings etc.. Additional info: What is an anagram? How many loops do you need for this task? How can you break down this problem into smaller sub-tasks? Solve these sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer! Hint: Use sets! \nAnswer: \nAn Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging letters of another word or phrase such as cinema which can be formed by rearranging letters from iceman . We need 2 loops for this task since we have 2 words that we need to compare i.e., w1 , w2 . The first loop will be used on w1 while second loop will be used on w2 . The problem can be broken down into smaller subtasks as follows: 1) Create a function that takes in 2 strings as parameters i.e., s1 , s2 . 2) Convert both strings into sets so that they become unordered collections of unique elements 3) Check if both sets contain same elements using == operator 4) If yes then return true else return false 5) After creating our main function call it with two strings passed as arguments 6) Print True or False depending upon whether both strings are Anagrams or not respectively 7) Call our main function from outside so that",

If you want to know how to solve the problem, look at the other answers.  They're great!  I encourage you to read them and try them out.  They'll help you learn python!   Some of them are a little more complicated than necessary, but I think that's because they're trying to teach you some cool stuff about python.   There's no need for that here, so I'll just answer your questions directly.   This is probably not what you want, but it is an answer! :)    (And if it isn't what you want, please let me know!)  Here goes...   :)\n\n - Which data structure is being used? Can the task be split into smaller sub-tasks? How many loops are needed to solve the tasks? Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer\n\n - The data structure is a list of tuples. You could use a dictionary instead if each index was unique (that would be better).   You can split this task into smaller tasks; in fact that's exactly what we do when we write functions in programming languages like Python or C++ or Java or C# or... well, pretty much any programming language.  We break things down into small pieces and write functions for each piece so that we don't have one huge function that does everything all at once (which would be very hard to understand).   In this case there are two small tasks: first find the values of each tuple and put them into a list; second multiply all those values together.     Here's how I'd write those two functions:\n\n <code>def get_values(lst):</code> <code>return [i[1] for i in lst]</code> <code></code><br/> <code>def multiply_values(lst):</code><br/> <code>prod = 1</code><br/> <code>for i in lst:</code><br/> <code></tab><tab><tab><tab><tab><tab><tab>prod *= i[1]</tab></tab></tab></tab></tab></tab></i&gt;<br/> &n",
