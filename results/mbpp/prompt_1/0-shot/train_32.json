You can just check if the two numbers are equal and then add to your <code>sum</code>. The reason is that <code>a^b==0</code> only if a=b. So you can write it like this: <code>(i == j)</code>. This way you don't have to loop over the array twice. You can simply do this in one loop by checking each element against itself and adding it to your <code>sum</code>. Then check each element against every other element and add it to your <code>sum</code>. This way you're still only looping through the array once. If you did this with a nested loop then you would be doing more work than necessary. Here is an example of what I mean:  https://repl.it/@jordanhudgens/Xor-Example#main.py . Also note that I changed your variable name from <code>sum</code>, which is a built-in function in python, to something else so as not to confuse anyone who reads your code later on. Also note that there are better ways of writing this code by using list comprehensions or sets but I'm trying to keep things simple here since it seems like you're new at programming and learning how loops work etc..

I am not sure what the question is asking, but I think it's asking how many loops are needed to solve the task.  The answer is two loops, one nested inside the other.  The outer loop runs from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>, and the inner loop runs from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>.  This gives a total of n * n = n^2 iterations, which is O(n^2).   You can use this formula to find out how many iterations a nested loop will make: outerloop * innerloop.  If you have two innerloops, it would be outerloop * innerloop1 * innerloop2.   In your case you only have one nested loop so the formula is just outerloop * innerloop = n^2.   If you had another nested loop it would be n*n*n = n^3 and so on...  Hope this helps! :)   \n",
