However, there are still some things that can be improved: \n1. Use descriptive variable names  - <code>i</code> and <code>f</code>.   What do they mean? How about <code>candidate</code>, or <code>testValue</code>.  This will make your code easier to read and understand when you come back to it after a few months (or years).   Also, use meaningful names for functions and methods - <code>findMin()</code>, instead of just <code>find()</code>.  This will make your code more self-documenting so that you don't have to explain what it does in comments (which is good because comments tend to get out of date).   If you use descriptive names then other people reading your code will be able to understand what it does without having to read through all the comments!     It's also easier for other people reading your code to give suggestions as they can see exactly what you're trying to achieve without having to figure out what each variable means first!   If I was reviewing this I would probably rename these variables before I even started looking at anything else!       You have used meaningful names with the exception of these two variables which really stand out like a sore thumb!      Also, try not to use magic numbers such as 10 or 4 in your code - define them at the top as constants so that they're easy to change later on if necessary without having to look through all your code for every place where they appear.       e.g.:      MAXIMUM_VALUE = 10     MINIMUM",

The solution Here's a simple algorithm that works well in practice: Start with an initial estimate of the answer being zero (i.e., start with $x=0$). Then while increasing $x$ by one at a time still gives an answer, keep doing so until you get to a value where increasing it further would no longer give an answer (i.e., until there exists some key \\$k\\in[1..N]\\$ such that \\$f(x+k)< f(x)\\$. Then do a binary search between these two values of x to find the smallest possible value for which there's no answer (i.e., find the smallest value for which there exists some key \\$k\\in[1..N]\\$ such that $\\texttt{f}(\\texttt{x}+k)< f(\\texttt{x})$.

It returns the smallest item in an iterable or the smallest of two or more arguments. So you can use it as follows:  <code>min([1,2,3,4])</code>. It will return 1.  Also you can use <code>max</code> function to find maximum value in a list. It returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments. So you can use it as follows:  <code>max([1,2,3,4])</code>. It will return 4.   You can also pass key function as parameter to get what you want like this:   <code>min([-8,-16,-32,-64], key=abs)</code>. In this case it will return -8 because absolute value of -8 is less than all other values and abs(-8) == 8 . Hope this helps!   Here is link to documentation for min and max functions https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#min and https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max . Also here is link to documentation for key function https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-key-function .  If you have any questions feel free to ask! Good luck! :)    Here is example code that uses min and max functions:   `x = [10, 20, 30] print(\"Minimum Value is: \", min(x)) print(\"Maximum Value is: \", max(x))` This code will output `Minimum Value is: 10 Maximum Value is 30`. This should help you better understand min and max functions! :)     Also here are some examples of how key function works `print(\"Minimum Absolute Value\", min([-8,-16,-32,-64], key=abs)) print(\"Maximum Absolute Value\", max([-8,-16,-32,-64], key=abs))` This code will output `Minimum Absolute Value -8 Maximum Absolute Value 64`.
