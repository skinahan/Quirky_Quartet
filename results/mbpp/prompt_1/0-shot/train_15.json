A docstring is a special string that goes at the beginning of your function and describes what it does. You can use triple quotes to make it multiline. Here's an example:\n\u00a0 <code>def convertToMilesPerHour(kilometersPerSecond):</code>\n\u00a0 <code>\"\"\"Converts kilometers per second to miles per hour.</code>\n\u00a0 <code></code>\n\u00a0 <code>:param kilometersPerSecond: number of kilometers per second</code>\n\u00a0 <code>:returns: number of miles per hour</code>\n\u00a0 <code></code>\n\u00a0 <code>:rtype: float</code>\n\u00a0 <`\"\"\"`\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You can also write tests for your code to make sure it's correct. For example if you were writing a function that adds two numbers together you could write a test for this case and then one for when one or both parameters are negative and so on. That way if your code fails any test you know something went wrong with it and you can fix it. It's also good practice because if later on someone else needs to change your code they will know what parts they can change without breaking anything by looking at your tests. There are many different testing frameworks but unittest is pretty common and easy to use so I would suggest starting there.\n\n",
