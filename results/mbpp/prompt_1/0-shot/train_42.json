My only suggestion is that you could simplify the regex by removing the <code>[^z]</code>: <code>\\w*z\\w*</code>.  This will still match any word containing 'z' not at the start or end of the word.  Note that this would also match words like \"zzzz\", which your original regex would not.  However, since your question doesn't specify how to handle multiple instances of 'z', this might be a good thing.  \nAlso, if you want to make sure that there are no other letters between the first and second z's, just add a + after each \\w*: <code>\\w+z\\w+</code>.  \n",
