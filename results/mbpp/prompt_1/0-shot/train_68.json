I would add a couple of things:\nFirst of all, you should use <code>re.match</code>, not <code>re.search</code>.  The latter will find the first match in the string; the former will only match if the entire string matches.  This is what you want here -- you want to know whether the entire string is a valid IP address or not.   In your code as written, if your input was \"192.168.0.12foo\", it would be considered valid because \"192.168\" matches your regexp!  Using <code>re.match</code> fixes that problem (and incidentally gets rid of one of your parentheses).   You should also use raw strings (<code>r'...'</code>) for regular expressions; this makes it easier to write them correctly and avoids having to double up on backslashes (which can be confusing).  So I'd rewrite this as:\n<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">\n<p><pre><code>&lt;code&gt;import re\ndef valid_ip(ip): return bool(re.match(r'^[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}$', ip))&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p></blockquote>\n\n",
