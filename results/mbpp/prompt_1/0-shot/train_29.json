For example <code>(2,3)</code> would return <code>[(1,3),(3,3),(2,4),(2,2)]</code>.  The question is asking how many loops are needed to solve the problem.  Since we are not iterating over any data structure in this case there are no loops.  The question also asks about splitting into smaller tasks.  In this case I would say that the task can be split into two sub-tasks: add one to x and subtract one from x and add one to y and subtract one from y.   This can be accomplished with two separate functions or by using nested functions or lambdas as shown below.  \n<code>def get_neighbors(coordinate):\n\n    def plusone_minusone(a):\n\n        return lambda b: [b+1 , b-1]\n\n    x ,y = coordinate\n\n    neighbors = []\n\n    neighbors += map(plusone_minusone(y) , [x]) # Add/subtract 1 from x and keep same value for y\n\n    neighbors += map(plusone_minusone(x) , [y]) # Add/subtract 1 from y and keep same value for x\n\n    return neighbors                            # Return list of tuples of adjacent coordinates in 2D grid    \n</code>\n",
