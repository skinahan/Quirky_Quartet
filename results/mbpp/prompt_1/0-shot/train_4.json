It works by checking every number between <code>2</code> and <code>sqrt(n)</code>. If any of them divides <code>n</code>, then <code>n</code> is not prime, otherwise it is prime.  This solution runs in time O(sqrt(N)).  There are faster ways to do it (e.g., using Sieve of Eratosthenes).  But this one is probably the easiest and most intuitive way to do it.  If you want to learn about other ways to check for primality, Google \"primality test\".   You can also check out this Wikipedia page on Primality Tests for more information.   The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm can be found here on Wikipedia as well as a lot of other places on the internet.   I think that's all there really is to say about this question... unless you want me to go into more detail about how the algorithm works, or what O() notation means, or what a sieve is... but I guess those are all things you can look up yourself :)  Hope that helps!   Good luck with your studies! :)  Cheers! -KiwiBirdDesigns (aka KDB) :)     P.S.: Another thing I should mention is that there are some numbers which are called \"Carmichael numbers\" which will fool this algorithm into thinking they're prime when they're not... but that's pretty rare so don't worry too much about it unless you're working with very large numbers (like over 10^100). In that case, just use Sieve of Eratosthenes instead because it doesn't get fooled by Carmichael numbers :) Cheers again! :D -KDB      P.P.S.: Here's a link to an example program which shows how these algorithms work: http://www.programmingsimplified.com/c/source-code/c-program-check-prime .
