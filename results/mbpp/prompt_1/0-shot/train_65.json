Try this.  It's not that much different than yours.   The only thing I've done is to replace the loop with a list comprehension, and then I use the built-in <code>sum</code> function to sum up the number of times <code>c == char</code>.  That will give you your total number of matches for <code>char</code>.   I also added a test case at the end, so it's easy to see what it does.     If you're not familiar with list comprehensions, they're really just a concise way of writing a loop to create lists.   In this case, we're using them to create a list containing True or False depending on whether or not each character in <code>string</code> matches <code>char</code>.   Then we use the built-in function sum() to add up all the True values (which are equivalent to 1) in that list.     Here's my version:    \n<code>def count_char(string, char):\n\n    return sum([True for c in string if c == char])\n\n # Test case below:  prints out 2 (because there are two z's)     \n\n print(count_char(\"abczc\", \"z\"))       # prints 2     \n</code>\n",
