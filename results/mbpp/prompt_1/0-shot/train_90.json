You can simplify your code by using the <code>dict.setdefault</code> method to avoid checking whether the key exists before adding it to the dictionary. The method takes two arguments; a key and a value and does two things, it returns either the value associated with that key or the default value that you pass as an argument if no such value exists in the dictionary. The second thing it does is insert that default value into the dictionary as long as there wasn't already a mapping for that key.
