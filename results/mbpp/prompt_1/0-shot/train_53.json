The perimeter is twice the sum of the height and width.  You can use two different approaches to solve this problem.  You can either use loops or you can do it by hand.  When you do it by hand, you will see that you only need to add the height plus the width twice.  This is because there are two sides with length equal to height and two sides with length equal to width.  \n",
