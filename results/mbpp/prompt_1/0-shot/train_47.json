It's not the most efficient one though. It's a good idea to use <code>enumerate</code>, which will give you both index and value in each iteration. Also, instead of using the <code>reversed</code> function, you can swap values with a tuple assignment: \n<code>for i, val in enumerate(lst):  # this will give you both index and value of each element in the list \n\n    if (i + 1) % n == 0:  # if the next element is an n-th element\n\n        lst[i], lst[i + 1] = lst[i + 1], val  # swap values at indexes i and i + 1 \n\n        # note that this line does not require any additional checks for indices being out of range - it works correctly even if there is no next element to swap with (e.g., when i == len(lst) - 2) \n\n    else: pass   # do nothing otherwise (this line may be omitted)  \n</code>\n",
