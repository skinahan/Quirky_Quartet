This will give you a set of all elements that are both present in the original list and are unique in it. Then you have to convert this set back to a list (using <code>list()</code>) and sort it (using <code>.sort()</code>) if you want to get exactly the same output as your function gives.  Finally you can use <code>.remove()</code> method of lists to remove all occurrences of each element from this list except first one (the last part is optional). I would write it like this:  \n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;def duplicants(lst):     # The name of the function should be different than its argument name!     # Also there is no need for docstring or comments here - they will just take up space without adding much value.  \n\n    l = list((set(lst)).intersection(lst))   # Convert set back to a list so we can sort it later on     # Find intersection between original list and its set version - this will give us only unique elements that are also present in the original list  \n\n    l.sort()                                 # Sort our temporary result so we get exactly same output as your function does  \n\n    for i in range (len (l)-1):              # Remove all duplicates except first one - optional part     # Loop through indices 0..len-1 of our temporary result     \n\n        l.remove (l[i])                      # Remove an element from our temporary result at index i+1     \n\n                                            # Note that removing an element shifts indices down by 1     \n\n                                ",
