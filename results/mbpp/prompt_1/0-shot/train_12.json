This will return the tuple with the maximum value.  If you want just the maximum value, use <code>max(input_list, key=lambda x : x[1])[1]</code>.   The reason you need a lambda is that <code>max()</code> will try to compare tuples by comparing each element from left to right.  In your case that isn't what you want.  You want it to compare based on just the second element of each tuple.   So you have to tell it which element to use for comparison using a lambda function that returns just that one element.   If your tuples had more than two elements and you wanted to compare based on some other index then you would change the <code>[1]</code>.  For example if it was index 2 then it would be <code>[2]</code>, etc...   This is also called currying and is a common technique in functional programming languages where functions are treated as first class objects and can be passed around like any other variable or object.     The documentation for python's built-in functions is here http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max .     There are examples there too which show how to use lambdas as keys when calling max().

You could do something like this instead of writing a function at all:     print(f\"The maximum value in record list as tuple attribute in the given tuple list is {max([x[1] for x in input_list])}",

A better name would be something like <code>getMaxValueFromListOfTuples</code>, but that's up to you. Since you are only interested in the second value of each tuple (the maximum value), there is no need for a variable called <code>tupleListString</code>. I'd suggest naming it something like <code>(name, value)</code>, so that when reading through your code later on, it'll be easier to understand what each variable represents.
