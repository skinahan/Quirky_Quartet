You need to specify the key function which is used for sorting.  In your case you want to sort by the nth element.   This is done with <code>.operator.itemgetter()</code>.   You have to import this from module operator.   Then you can use the index of max value as parameter for <code>[n]</code>.   The result is the maximum of your nth element in all tuples of your list.   This works for lists and tuples with different lengths too because only that one element is compared which you specified by parameter [n].     For example:  <code>[1, 2, 3] &lt; [2, 3] == True because 1 &lt; 2 == True.</code>  If you want more details about this see Python documentation: Sorting HOW TOs and operator \u2014 Standard operators as functions.
