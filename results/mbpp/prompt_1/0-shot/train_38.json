It is already used as a built-in function. Use something like <code>total</code>. Also, you could use the built-in function <code>sum</code>:  <code>return sum([len(name) for name in names if name[0].isupper()])</code>.  I would also use the ternary operator:  <code>return sum([len(name) for name in names if (name[0].isupper() and len(name))])</code>. This way, you don't need to check if the length of the string is zero. Also note that this will also not count empty strings. If you want to count them, then do this instead:  <code>[len(name) or 1 for name in names]</code>, since an empty string has a length of zero. Finally, I would put parentheses around the conditionals so that it is more readable. This is what your code should look like:  \n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>&lt;code&gt;def sum_of_lengths(names):  \n\n    return sum([len(name) or 1 for name in names if (name[0].isupper() and len(name))])  \n\n print (sum_of_lengths((['John', 'Mary', 'peter']))) #6  \n\n print (sum_of_lengths((['John', 'Mary', 'peter', '']))) #7  \n\n print (sum_of_lengths((['john', 'mary', 'Peter']))) #5  \n\n print (sum_of_lengths(([]))) #0     (empty list). Note that this will be returned without any errors or warnings.     You can check it by printing it out yourself and see what happens when an empty list is inputted into your function. It works perfectly fine!     However, I would still add some error checking just to make",
