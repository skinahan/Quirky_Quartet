But you can optimize it.  You can break the loop when <code>j &gt;= amount - i</code>.  This will reduce the number of iterations substantially.  Also, you don't need to check for <code>j &lt;= 0</code>, as this will never happen (it's already checked by <code>for j in range(i+1, amount-i)</code>.   The final code would be like this:  \n<code>def no_profit_no_loss(amount):\n\n    for i in range(1, amount): # Omit check for 0 as it will always be false (see below)\n\n        for j in range(i+1, amount-i + 1 ): # Add 1 to omit the last element which is not needed (see below)\n\n            if i + j == amount: # Check condition here instead of outside the loop to save iterations.

This can also be omitted because True is returned by default when a function ends without returning anything explicitly.   So we could just write `pass` and it would work exactly like before.   But I think it's better to make it explicit that we are returning true at this point instead of leaving an implicit `pass` statement there with no comment on what it does or why is there and what does that mean.   It's more readable and maintainable this way IMO.  Also note that since we are returning true at this point then checking whether `amount == 0` at the beginning becomes unnecessary because if `amount == 0`, then both loops won't be executed and so nothing will be returned from them and therefore True will be returned implicitly anyway without any need to check again whether `amount == 0`. So removing that check saves one iteration too!    \n</code>\n",
