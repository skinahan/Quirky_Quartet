You can solve this problem using dynamic programming which will reduce the time complexity to polynomial order i.e O((N+K)*NK). Here's how you can do that -  Let <code>dp[i][j]</code> be the number ways to place <code>j</code> sized blocks inside an <code>i*i*i</code> sized box then we can calculate it as follows -     dp[0][0] = 1 , dp[0][j] = 0 for all j > 0 , dp[i][j] = sum{dp[i-1][x]} for all x >= j ; This can be done using bottom",
