Hence, later on we need to add one more step to this variable before returning it as final result because adding one step will take us exactly at that position pointed by this variable. That's why you can see in below line that we are returning 'best_jump+1' instead of just 'best_jump'. If you want, you can also store a number of steps value instead of an index value in above line (if (j + arr[j]) > bestJump) but then you need to change below line accordingly (return bestJump). But I think storing an index value is better than storing a number of steps value because it makes code easier to understand specially when dealing with edge cases like situation where there are two or more elements at same distance away from current position but only one element among them points towards end of the array while others don't point towards end or even worse",
