If no perfect square can be formed, return -1. Else return the maximum number of perfect squares that can be formed. The given numbers are in string format and they are separated by comma. The output is an integer value. For example, if the input is \"2,3\", then 2 will form 1 perfect square and 3 will form 0 perfect squares so the maximum number of perfect squares that can be formed is 1 and hence return 1 as output. If there are no elements in the input string then return 0 as output. You need to write a python function to solve this question and not a complete program to solve this question because we have already written code for reading inputs from console and printing out outputs on console which you need not modify or change or delete or remove or comment out or ignore etc., Also you don't need to read inputs from console nor print out outputs on console in your solution code as these things have been taken care by us already in our code which you need not modify etc., You just need to write your logic/code below where it says \"Write your code here\" without modifying anything else other than what is provided/suggested below i.e., you should NOT delete/remove any lines of code provided/suggested below even if they look unnecessary to you because those lines have been provided only for some specific reasons etc., Your solution should work with any kind of valid inputs without crashing with any kind of invalid inputs i.e., it should be robust enough i.e., your solution should handle all types of valid inputs gracefully without crashing with any kind of invalid inputs even if such invalid inputs are very huge also like say for example 100000 comma separated integers each having a value between 0-100000 inclusive but there may not be more than 100000 integers at least one integer must exist always but there may not be more than 100000 integers so your solution should work fine even if such huge number of integers were given as input like say for example \"1234,2345,",
