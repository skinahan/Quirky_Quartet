Use random module to generate input data sets. Please note that you are not allowed to use any inbuilt python library method which directly solves this problem. Your code should be in such a way that it can be used as a module by other programs also. You can use any IDE or code editor of your choice. Save your code with .py extension and upload it on google drive or github and share the link with us. Please do not upload .ipynb file as we do not have Jupyter notebook installed on our system. Also write detailed instructions on how we can run your code on our system using command line terminal in a text file named README and upload it along with your code files on google drive or github and share the link with us. We will download all these files from google drive or github before running them on our system so please make sure that you have uploaded all necessary files including input data set(s) if any, test files if any, etc before sharing the link with us otherwise we will not be able to run your code successfully on our system even though there might not be any error when you run it on your own system because some necessary file(s) might be missing from your submission which may lead to error when we try to run it on our system without those missing file(s).
