The letters in the word can be used only once. For example: \"aabbcdd\" has 3 palindromes which are \"bb\", \"cc\", and \"aa\". A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backwards as forwards. A permutation is an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects, with regard to the order of the arrangement. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set {1,2,3}, namely (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1 3), (2 3 1), (3 1 2), and (3 2 1). These are all different arrangements; so the set of permutations is countably infinite. The key notion is that the elements are taken in a definite order whereas if they were taken with regard to being members of a set only their membership would be relevant and not any particular ordering. The concept is fundamental in both combinatorics and symmetric functions. Other examples involve sequences such as words in natural languages where different orderings give rise to different meanings. The name derives from Latin per mutare meaning 'through change'.
