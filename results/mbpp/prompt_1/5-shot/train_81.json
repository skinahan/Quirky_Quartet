Using the distance formula. The distance formula is \u221a((x2\u2212x1)^2+(y2\u2212y1)^2). The task is to find k closest points to the origin. If there are more than k points on the same distance consider only one of them. The output should contain all k closest points sorted by their distances in non-decreasing order. If less than k points are present then output all of them sorted by their distances in non-decreasing order. In case there are multiple solutions with same minimal distance then choose lexicographically least among them. In case there is no point present then return an empty array []. The first line contains an integer t denoting number of test cases. For each testcase there will be two lines input, first line contains an integer n denoting total number of given points and second line contains n pairs xi and yi separated by space where ith pair denotes coordinates (xi ,yi ) for ith point respectively . Third line contains value of K . Output: For each testcase print K closest points to origin in non-decreasing order sorted by their distances if possible otherwise empty array []. Note : Distance between two points (X1 , Y1 ) and (X2 , Y2 ) is sqrt((X1 - X2) * (X1 - X2) + (Y1 - Y2)*(Y1 - Y2)). Input: 1 4 0 0 1 1 3 3 2 Output: 0 0 1 1 Explanation: There are 4 given pairs with coordinates as mentioned above where origin is at (0,0). So we have to find 2 closest pairs from these 4 pairs i.e., 2 closest coordinates from these 4 coordinates with respect to origin which is at (0,0). So distace between this pair and origin i.e., distace between (0,0) and other pairs will be 0 for pair (0,0), sqrt(5) for pair (-3,-3), sqrt(5) for pair (-3,-3",
