The equations are derived from these facts. For example, if we have placed all dominoes vertically on first column, then we can place only horizontally on second column and so on... And vice versa! So, we get recursive relations as follows - A(n) = A(n-2) + 2*B(n-1), B(n) = A(n-1)+B(n-2). Now using these recurrences and initial conditions (A0=1, A1=0, B0=0, B1=1), we can calculate An and Bn till nth column! There you go! The required number of ways thus become An+Bn at the end! :) Hope this helps!!
