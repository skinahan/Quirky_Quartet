The scorecard is a tuple with three elements. The first two elements are integers and the last element is a string. This string can be 'D' or 'I'. If it's 'D', then we double the first two elements and if it's 'I', then we increment the first element by 1. You need to find out which operation to perform in each step so as to maximize the sum of all three elements in each score card. For example, if there are 3 score cards [(1, 2, 'D'), (3, 4, 'I'), (5, 6, 'D')] then for (1, 2,'D') you have two choices - either double both numbers or increment only 1st number by 1. You have to choose whichever gives you a higher value after performing that operation on all 3 tuples from above example [(2, 4), (4 ,4), (10 ,12)] so here answer will be 26 as sum of all 3 tuples is 26 after performing operations on them as per their last character in tuple which is D or I respectively for above example. Similarly for other examples also you have to do same operations on tuples and find out max sum out of them at end like for [(2 ,3 ,'I'),(6 ,8,'I'),(1 ,3,'D')] answer will be 23 as sum of all 3 tuples after doing operations on them will give us max value 23 at end like [(3 ,3) ,(7 ,8) ,(2 ,6)] whose total sum is 18 + 15 + 8 = 41 but we need max value so answer will be 23 only as this is max value possible by doing operations on these tuples and similarly for other examples also you have to do same thing and find out max values at end like for [(2 ,5,'I'),(12,15,'I'),(15,19,'D')] answer will be 75 only even though total sum comes 89 but we need only max value possible i.e 75 here by doing appropriate operations on these tuples based upon their last character D or I respectively in each tuple like [(3 5) (13",

The list can contain integers, floats and complex numbers. Hint: Use isinstance() function to check if an element is integer, float or complex number. The sum should be returned as a complex number.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nWhich data structure is being used? Can the task be split into smaller sub-tasks? How many loops are needed to solve the tasks? Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer. Is there any other way you can solve this problem? How can you modify your code if we want to add some more datatypes (say Decimal)? What will happen if we do not use type checking (isinstance)? What will happen if we pass an empty list? Can you write some more test cases for your code? What happens when you remove type checking from your code and execute it for below test case lst = [20+5j, 10+5j] ? Why does it fail for this particular case? Why does it work for all other cases even after removing type checking from our code? Think about this one! You may need this concept in future! :) Hint: Use dir() function on any object/datatype/variable in python shell/interpreter and see what methods/attributes it has! :) Google out more about dir() function :) Happy Coding!! :D :D :D This question is part of Python Data Types module's assignment series! Check out my GitHub repo here - https://github.com/AkshayKumarGutha/Python-DataTypes-Assignments where I have uploaded solutions of all assignments till now! Start solving them one by one and enjoy learning Python :) Cheers!! :) Happy Learning!! :) Happy Coding!! :D :D Keep Learning!! Keep Growing!! Cheers!! :) PYTHON IS LIFE!!!
