Don't change any of the existing code in these classes, just write your solution within them so that they can be used for testing purposes (We will import your solution and test it against our own tests). If you need more classes or functions, you can define them but make sure they are within these three classes because our tests will import only these three classes from your solution file. Don't use any external libraries or data structures like collections package from Python standard library or any other external library. You can use basic data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries etc., that come with Python 3 by default for creating your tree structure if needed but don't use any external libraries or data structures like collections package from Python standard library or any other external library as mentioned above and also don't change/delete any existing attributes or methods of these three classes given below (We will import your solution and test it against our own tests).
