The list of numbers can contain duplicates as well. The order of elements does not matter i.e., (2, 1) and (1, 2) are considered same. The pairs should be printed in sorted order i.e., if n1 and n2 are part of a pair then print them as (n1, n2). Also, print each pair only once i.e., if (n1, n2) is already printed then do not print (n2, n1). Also, if a pair is such that one element is present multiple times in the list then print it only once e.g., let's say 5 appears thrice in the list and 7 appears twice and if k = 2 then output should be 3 as there are 3 unique pairs with difference 2: (5, 7), (7, 5), and (5, 5). Note that we don't consider any pair whose both elements are same e.g., let's say 5 appears thrice in the list then we don't consider any pair with both elements being 5 as such pairs will not have any difference at all so output here should be 0 even though there are three 5s present in the input list but no unique pair has been formed from them which satisfy our condition of having difference equal to k which was passed to our function as an argument. Do note that output can be greater than or equal to zero but can never be negative for any valid input values of k and nums arraylist passed to this function as arguments since we will always have at least one element present in nums arraylist so there will always exist at least one number which would have some other number with itself having some difference between them equal to k value passed as an argument to this function call even if it means using same number twice like shown above where both elements were 5 but still had a difference between them equal to 2 after taking modulo by 10 operation on their values because they were repeated numbers so they didn't form any unique pair hence they were not counted towards getting",

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string \"\". All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z. You may assume all inputs are valid. Do not use built-in functions or libraries to solve this problem. String manipulation and data structures are used to solve this problem. Try not to use any additional imports/libraries that you may need while solving this problem. The solution should be very simple and readable with O(n) time complexity where n is the number of elements in the input list of strings and O(1) space complexity where 1 is for storing the result value only (not for storing any other intermediate values). It should be very simple and readable with only one loop using slicing operator [:] which has been explained below with examples: s[start:end] # items start through end-1 s[start:] # items start through the rest of the string s[:end] # items from the beginning through end-1 s[:] # a copy of the whole string (slower than s * n) s[start:end:step] # start through not past end, by step The key point is that the slice selects all characters up to but not including the final character selected. This is also true when using negative values for step, or when omitting start or end. For example, if we want to select all characters from position 5 onwards until position 1 from last then we can use following code snippet: myString = '123456789' print(\"myString = \", myString) print(\"myString[5:-1] = \", myString[5:-1]) Output will be as follows: myString = 123456789 myString[5:-1] = 6789 Similarly if we want to select all characters except first two then we can use following code snippet: myString = '123456789' print(\"myString = \", myTaskWrite a python function to solve the above question.
