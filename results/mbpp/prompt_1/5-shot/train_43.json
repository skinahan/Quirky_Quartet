If no such palindrome exists, print -1. For example, if the input is 1234, the output should be 1331. If the input is 99, the output should be 101. For numbers with an even number of digits (like 1234), you need to consider both middle two digits as well as left and right sides separately. In case of numbers with an odd number of digits (like 99), you need to consider both middle digit and left and right sides separately. So in case of 99, 101 is considered as its next highest palindrome because it considers 01 on left side and 00 on right side whereas 999 would not be considered as its next highest palindrome because it considers only 0 on right side but not 00 on left side. You can assume that all inputs are valid positive integers. The upper bound for value of integer can be upto 100000000000 (10^12).\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.

In addition to this, we disallow use of eval() function too since we want you to solve this problem without using eval() . We also disallow use of any external libraries/modules like numpy , scipy etc.. which might help in solving this problem quickly or easily unless explicitly mentioned otherwise later in this task itself i.e., allowed or disallowed status of external libraries might change from question to question depending upon what we are looking for",
