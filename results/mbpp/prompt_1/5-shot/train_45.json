Return the minimum value and maximum value as tuple (min_value, max_value). If no items are present in the dictionary then return (None, None). Do not use built-in min() and max() functions. Return (None, None) for an empty dictionary. Hint: You can use for loop to iterate over all key/value pairs in a dictionary. Use float('inf') and float('-inf') to represent positive infinity and negative infinity respectively. For more information on these functions refer here . Do not use any other imports. Note that you may only use built-in functions which are already available in the question environment. So do not import any modules or write helper functions to solve this problem. You may create new variables as needed but do not store anything in a list or other data structure as it will interfere with unit tests which test your code against different input values. Also do not modify keys or values of the given dictionary while iterating over it as it is used directly by unit tests which test your code against different input values. Note that keys of the given dictionary may be integers or strings so make sure that you handle both cases appropriately when writing your solution code (for example when adding two numbers you should convert string keys into integers before adding them). Also note that if key is an integer then its value will always be an integer too but if key is string then its value could be integer, string or list depending on what was passed as input by user during function call . For example {'a': 10} is valid input whereas {'a': [10]} is invalid input since we have specified that each item's value should be either int or str type only but never list type so make sure that your solution does not crash for such invalid inputs by explicitly checking for this case using type() function before doing any processing on item's value . Also note that all inputs will be valid so you do not need to handle exceptions related to invalid inputs e.g., ValueError exception raised by int() function when trying to convert a non integer string into an integer; TypeError exception",
