If there are multiple elements that appears maximum number of times, print the smallest one. For example, for the list [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1], it should print 1. If the given list is empty, then it should return None. Use dictionary to solve this problem. You can assume that all elements of input lists are hashable.

If the number is a perfect square, return true, else return false. Return 0 for invalid input. (A perfect square is an integer which is the product of some integer with itself) For example, 4, 9 and 16 are some of the perfect squares. The input comes as one string element that needs to be checked if it\u2019s a perfect square or not. The output should be printed to the console - \"true\" or \"false\". In case of invalid input print 0. For more information check out this link - Perfect Square (Wikipedia).

For example if you pass 5 and 7 as parameters your function should return 12 without using any of these operators (+,-,*,/,%).
