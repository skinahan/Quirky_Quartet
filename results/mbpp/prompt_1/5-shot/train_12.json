Record is a tuple of (index, value) type and records is a list of records with index and value attributes. Lambda expression will be provided by us during evaluation of your code. Please do not hardcode it or use any other values during testing your code locally or on our platform else you will get an error while evaluation of your code on our platform as we will provide different values for lambda expression than what you have used while testing locally or on our platform.   Use only one line after return statement to complete this task using lambda expressions, min() function and map() function together without using any additional variables outside this method or inside this method except one variable which can be used inside return statement to store result returned by min() function invoked with map() function as argument along with lambda expression as argument for map(). If you have written more than one line after return statement then you will get an error while evaluation of your code on our platform as we have already mentioned that use only one line after return statement to complete this task using lambda expressions, min() function and map() function together without using any additional variables outside this method or inside this method except one variable which can be used inside return statement to store result returned by min() function invoked with map() functiion along with lambda expression as argument for map(). Do not use any other values except those we have mentioned above else you will get an error while evaluation of your code on our platform as we have already mentioned that use only those values which we have mentioned above else you will get an error while evaluation of your code on our platform due to violation of constraints mentioned in previous lines before these lines so please read all lines carefully before starting implementation",
