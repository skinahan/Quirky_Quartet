If no such triplets can be formed, return an empty list. For example, solution([-3,0,1,2,-1,-4,-2]) should return [[-3,-2,5],[-3,-1,4],[-3,0,3],[-3,1,2],[-2,-1,3],[-2,0,2],[-1,0 , 1]]. Note that solution should not return duplicate triplets. For example [-5 , -5 , 10] is a valid triplet but it should not be included in the output because [-5 , 10 , -5] already exists in it. Similarly [0 , 0 , 0] is also a valid triplet but it should not be included as well since [0 , 0 , 0] and [-0 , 0 , 0] are equivalent as far as lists are concerned since they contain exactly same elements albeit in different order. The order of elements inside each triplet does not matter i.e [[-5,-4,-10]] is considered equivalent to [[10,-4,-5]] or [[10,-5,-4]] or any other permutation for that matter and hence only one of them needs to be included in solution . In general if we have two lists A and B where A contains exactly same elements as B but they are arranged differently then they will be considered equivalent by python lists and hence only one of them needs to be returned by solution . Also note that duplicates inside each individual list must also be removed e.g [-20 4 4 ] is invalid because it contains duplicate 4\u2019s whereas [20 4 -20 ] or [20 -20 4 ] or any other permutation with no duplicates inside it will be accepted by solution .
