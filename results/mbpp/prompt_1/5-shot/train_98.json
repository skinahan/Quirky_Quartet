If it is a prime number, return True, else return False. Also write the pytest test cases to test the program. Refer to the sample test cases below. Note: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \u2026}. For example: 2 is a prime number as it has only two positive divisors 1 and 2. 1 is not a prime number as it has only one positive divisor i.e., 1 itself. 4 is not a prime number as it has three positive divisors i.e., 1, 2 and 4 (not considering negative numbers). Sample Input : 13 Sample Output : True Sample Input : 18 Sample Output : False Test Cases:- Test Case\tInput\tOutput\tExplanation Test Case 01\t13\tTrue\tSince 13 has only two positive divisors i.e., 1 and 13 so 13 is said to be Prime Number Test Case 02\t18\tFalse\tSince 18 has more than two positive divisors i.e., 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 18 so 18 is said to be composite Number Test Case 03\t31\tTrue Since 31 has only two positive divisors i.e., 31 and 1 so 31 is said to be Prime Number Test Case 04 0 False Since 0 does not have any positive divisor other than zero itself so 0 cannot be considered as either Prime or Composite Number Test Case 05 -5 False Since -5 does not have any positive divisor other than zero itself so -5 cannot be considered as either Prime or Composite Number Task: Write python code for the above mentioned question along with respective pytest test cases .
