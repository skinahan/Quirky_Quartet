The function should return the average of even numbers till that given number if the number is even otherwise it should return the average of odd numbers till that given number if the number is odd. For example, avg_till(5) should return 3 and avg_till(6) should return 4.5. You can assume that input will always be a positive integer. Also write appropriate docstrings and comments for your function. You are not allowed to use any in-built functions other than len(). Do not use any global variables or variables other than those passed as parameters to your function (if any). Do not import any module/library/package for this task. If you are using Python 2, you can ignore all exceptions raised by division operation and simply assume that it will work fine in Python 2 as well as Python 3. Note: In case of tie (i.e., if there are two averages with same value), consider the smaller value to be the answer and break ties by considering the lower value to be correct answer among two possibilities with same average values but different numbers considered for calculating averages). For example, avg_till(4) returns 2 but not 3 though both are correct answers but we consider only 2 because it is smaller than 3 and also because we have considered only even integers while finding average in this case whereas odd integer 3 has been considered while finding average in case where output is 3 (i.e., avg_till(5)). So when there are two possibilities with same averages but one possibility considers only even integers while calculating average whereas another possibility considers odd integers while calculating average then we break ties by considering only those possibilities which consider only even integers while calculating averages as correct answers over those possibilities which consider both even and odd integers together while calculating averages because among two possibilities with same averages, we prefer considering only even integers over considering both even and odd together when there are multiple such possibilities which give us same answer after breaking ties using first condition mentioned above i.e., we prefer smaller value among those having same averages after breaking ties using first condition mentioned above). Similarly, when",

Assume that all the elements are positive integers. Return the list of numbers and their indices. If there is more than one maximum number, return all of them. If there is no maximum value, return None. Do not use built-in functions to solve this question. You can use one loop only to solve this question. You can write additional functions if needed but you cannot use any other loops except one loop in the main function to solve this question and also you cannot use any other data structures like lists or dictionaries to solve this question except for two variables which will contain indices and maximum values respectively in your main function as mentioned above. Also note that your code will be auto-evaluated by our system so do not add any extra print statements or input statements or unnecessary comments etc., which are not required for solving this question as it may lead to incorrect output format error while auto-evaluation by our system which may result in partial marks deduction or zero marks deduction depending on the nature of such errors so please be careful while writing your code and avoid such mistakes as much as possible. Also note that you should not modify the given input list at all because it may lead to errors during auto-evaluation by our system which may result in partial marks deduction or zero marks deduction depending on the nature of such errors so please be careful while writing your code and avoid such mistakes as much as possible but feel free to create new variables inside your main function if needed but do not modify the original input list at all because it may lead to errors during auto-evaluation by our system which may result in partial marks deduction or zero marks deduction depending on the nature of such errors so please be careful while writing your code and avoid such mistakes as much as possible . Also note that you should not modify any existing lines written by us already because doing so will result in compile time error when we try to run your code with our test cases due to syntax error etc., so please do not modify anything already given by us otherwise it will lead to compile time error when we try running your code with our test cases due to syntax error etc., Please read these instructions carefully before starting",
