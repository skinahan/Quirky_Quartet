The top k elements are made up of the maximum values from each possible window of size k. A window is a subset of the list containing the next consecutive numbers from the original list. For example, given [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7], and k = 3. Return [3, 3 ,5 ,5 ,6 7]. This is because 1st window of size k is [1 3 -1], 2nd window of size k is [-1 -3 5], and so on. So the topk elements are [3 3 5 5 6 7]. Note that if two windows have same maximum values then both values should be added to result in sorted order. You can assume that there will be no duplicates in input list and all values are non-negative integers. Also return an empty list if input or nums is None or empty or if there are not enough elements for a window to exist. Assume that 0 < nums[i] < 1000 where 0 <= i < len(nums). Assume 0 <= n <= len(nums). Do this in O(nlogk) time complexity using heap queue algorithm where n is the number of elements and k is the number of windows you need to consider at any point in time during processing (not equal to total number of windows). You can use built-in functions/libraries for min/max heaps but write your own algorithm for finding topK max numbers efficiently without using built-in libraries/functions/APIs (except built-in sorting API). Do not modify input array nums. Return new array containing topK max numbers from each possible window (of size K) as described above . If there are less than K numbers left after considering current element then include all remaining numbers into result before moving on to next element since we have already considered K numbers before considering current element while processing previous windows and we will never get back to those previous windows again since we always move forward considering new elements one at",

Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer. What is Recursion? What is Base Case and Recursive Case in Recursion? How many recursive calls can be made at max for a problem of size n? Write down all possible recursive calls made by your code snippet on paper, if it were to calculate fibonacci sequence of length 5 (fibonacci numbers from 0 - 4). Do you see any overlapping subproblems in your approach? Is there any better way to solve this problem by taking advantage of overlapping subproblems, so that we don't have to re-compute them again and again during each recursive call ? Also, write down what kind of data structure can we use here, which will help us store results of already computed subproblems and reuse them when required ? This will help us achieve time complexity better than O(2^N). If you are not able to think about it right now, don't worry ! We will soon learn how Dynamic Programming works ! For now, just focus on writing a recursive code snippet which works correctly for given input size ! Once you have done that, try implementing it iteratively as well without using recursion! Which approach do you think is better ? Why ? Also try comparing their runtimes using timeit module ! You can also try implementing this problem using memoization technique as well by storing results of already computed subproblems in some data structure like dictionary or list etc., so that they can be reused later on when required ! Compare their runtimes as well with naive approach and see how much faster your code becomes after applying memoization technique !
