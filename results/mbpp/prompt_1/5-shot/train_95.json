We do this until we reach top level call which will return final result as required by problem statement.   This way we have added all elements from nested tuples/lists in our final result variable res.   This is called depth first traversal of tree like structure formed by nested tuples/lists. Note that if we would have used breadth first traversal then order of elements in result would have been different than what it is now using depth first traversal (which is what I am using here).   Let me know if you want me to explain how breadth first traversal works with an example so you can compare both approaches and understand difference between them more clearly.       # add value only when element is not tuple or list (base case) - otherwise recursively call same function with element as input argument so that it can be added once its value has been calculated by child recursive calls (depth first approach).     # base case - add only when element is not tuple or list anymore (when there are no more child recursive calls required).     # when no more child recursive calls are required then add value of current element (which could be int or string etc.) to final result variable res and return it",
