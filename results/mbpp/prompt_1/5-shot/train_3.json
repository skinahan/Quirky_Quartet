Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer. What is the time complexity of this algorithm? Is it possible to improve it further? If yes, how can you improve it? Hint : Use dictionary data structure for faster lookups and better performance in terms of time complexity. Also, try using sliding window technique for better performance and better code readability.

No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nWhich data structure is being used? Can the task be split into smaller sub-tasks? How many loops are needed to solve the tasks? Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer. You can assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters of English alphabet. Examples : Input : X = \"abcdxyz\", y = \"xyzabcd\" Output : 4 The longest common substring is \"abcd\" and is of length 4. Input : X = \"zxabcdezy\", y = \"yzabcdezx\" Output : 6 The longest common substring is \"abcdez\" and is of length 6. Hint: Try using dynamic programming approach for this problem, i,e, use a 2D array (say dp[][]) with all entries initialized as 0, where dp[i][j] stores the longest common substring between x[0..i] and y[0..j]. If x[i] == y[j], we can recursively compute dp[i][j] as 1 + dp[i-1][j-1], otherwise max(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j]). Finally return value stored in dp table at index (m,n), where m and n are length of two input strings respectively. Time complexity of this solution will be O(m*n). Space complexity will be O(m*n) if we consider DP table as extra space or O(2*minLen) if we consider only two rows required for DP table at any time during execution of algorithm (Note that we don't need to store complete 2D array all time during execution). Please note that actual implementation may vary depending on language used but approach should remain same in all languages based on dynamic programming approach discussed above.)
