The longest consecutive elements sequence is defined as the one with maximum size. For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 0, 1], then the output should be 3 because there are 3 consecutive numbers [1, 2, 3] in the given list. If an empty list is provided to your function as an input argument then it should return 0. Note that you may not use built-in functions such as sort or max to solve this problem instead you should write your own logic and algorithm to solve this problem. The solution must be linear otherwise it will exceed time limit for larger data sets. You may assume that all inputs are valid and non-empty lists of integers and there are no duplicate numbers in any given list of integers. You may also assume that each number in a given list can be converted into type integer without raising any exception or error during conversion process. Also note that you cannot use global variables here but you can define local variables inside functions which will not affect other test cases when running multiple test cases simultaneously on our platform so feel free to define local variables inside functions if needed but do not use global variables here because they may affect other test cases when running multiple test cases simultaneously on our platform so we have restricted their usage here and you need to pass all arguments through function parameters only otherwise your code will fail at runtime while executing on our platform due to using global variables which have been restricted here so keep this thing in mind while writing your code for this question because we are running all test cases simultaneously on our platform which means that if you are using any global variable then it might get affected by some other test case which is being executed simultaneously with your current test case so try avoiding usage of global variables here because we have restricted their usage here and they might affect other test cases when running multiple test cases simultaneously on our platform so keep this thing in mind while writing your code for this question because we are running all test cases simultaneously on our platform which means that if you are using any global variable then it might get affected by some other test case which is being executed simultaneously with",

Here's an example input (note that this is not necessarily a valid input): [3,2,1,5,6], 2 Your function should return [1,2,3,5] as output in this case. You may assume that all elements in A are unique. Note: Do not mutate A! Feel free to use O(n) extra space for your solution if you'd like; however it isn't necessary as long as you're able to solve it with O(1) extra space (hint hint). Try implementing your solution without any extra space first! If you have time left over at work today try implementing both solutions! Also note that your code should run in linear time O(n). Hint 1: Try thinking about what information you need at each step of your algorithm before writing down any code! Hint 2: Try thinking about how you can use pointers or indices at each step of your algorithm before writing down any code! Hint 3: What invariants do we want our algorithm to maintain throughout its execution? Think about what properties our array must satisfy before we return it as output at each step of our algorithm... Hint 4: If we were going through an array like [3,-1,-4,-7], which would be better for us to pick as our pivot element? Why might choosing -4 or -7 be problematic? What would be better choices for pivots in these cases instead? Solution 1 def d",
