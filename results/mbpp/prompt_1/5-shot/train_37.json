The formula to compute the wind chill index is given below:\r\n\n\t\t\twind_chill = 35.74 + 0.6215 * temperature + (0.4275 * temperature - 35.75) * velocity ^ 0.16\r\n\n\t\twhere, temperature is in Fahrenheit and velocity is in miles per hour (mph). The input values must be read from user input and output should be printed as a result for the given inputs using function call in main().\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question by taking user inputs from console and print the result in console using main() method call only . No additional comments and docstrings are needed except docstring for main(). Use argparse module to take user inputs from console instead of input() method call . Also write one line comment on each line of code that you write as an answer for this task . Use only if-else conditionals , loops , arithmetic operators , comparison operators , logical operators , mathematical functions , list comprehensions with lambda function, string formatting etc.. Don't use any other built-in functions or methods or data structures like set(), dict(), tuple(), eval() etc.. Don't import any external packages also . Write your own logic without using any external references also . You can use only 'math' package methods like pow(), sqrt() etc.. Don't use 'math' package methods like sin(), cos() etc.. You can use 'from math import sqrt' statement if needed but don't import any other method from 'math' package except sqrt(). Your code should be case sensitive i.e., it should work with both uppercase letters and lowercase letters as input values . For example : If you are writing your code for calculating square root of x then it should work for both X as well as x i.e., it should work with both uppercase letter X and lowercase letter x either individually or together at same time . Also consider all possible cases while writing your answer i.e.,",
