For example, if first input parameter is [11, 8, 23, 14] and second input parameter is [23, 11, 8 , 11 ,14 ,8], then your function should return True because all elements of first list are present in second with same frequency (2 times), but if second input parameter was [23, 11 ,8 ,11 ,14], then your function should return False because 23 is present only once while it should have been twice according to first input parameter ([11, 8, 23]).

The list is sorted and the search will be done using binary search algorithm. If the element is not found in the list, return -1. Otherwise, return the index of first occurrence of x in lst. The expected time complexity of this function is O(log n). Assume that all elements in lst are distinct. Example: if lst = [2, 5, 5, 5, 8], then x=5 returns 1 (index of first occurence). If x=7 returns -1 since it's not present in the list. Similarly x=2 returns 0 and x=8 returns 4. Note that we are returning index and not count here! You can perform binary search only once here! Make sure to break your code into smaller sub-tasks so that you can easily find bugs if any! You may use built-in functions but make sure you understand how they work under-the-hood! Hint: Use recursion to solve this problem! If you are stuck on how to implement binary search recursively then try implementing it iteratively first and then convert into recursive form step by step! This question will help prepare you for interviews where interviewers expect you to write bug free code with no syntax errors within few minutes!
