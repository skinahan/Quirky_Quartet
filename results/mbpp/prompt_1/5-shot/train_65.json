The function should return -1 if no such element exists. Do not use built-in functions. Sort the list and return the second lowest value if it exists else return -1. Use of inbuilt functions is not allowed. The task is to complete the function secondSmallest() which takes a list as input parameter and returns an integer that denotes the second smallest element in the list or -1 if no such element exists. (Note: You have to write your logic only, do not change main() function.) For example, suppose we have a list [12, 13, 1, 10, 34, 1], then your function should return 10 as output because 10 is the second smallest element in this list. If there are more than one elements that are smaller than all other elements then consider any one of them as result (i.e., you can consider first minimum or last minimum). If there are less than two minimums then return -1 (i.e., there does not exist any such number). For example, suppose we have a list [12] then your function should return -1 because there does not exist any number which is smaller than all other elements in this case and hence there does not exist any number which is smaller than all other elements except itself (second smallest). Similarly for another example suppose we have a list [12] then your function should also return -1 because 12 itself is only one element and hence there does not exist any number which is smaller than all other elements except 12 itself (second smallest). Note that you can modify original array also by sorting it but don't do it here because it will affect evaluation of test cases so try to solve this problem by using O(n) extra space where n denotes size of input array where modification of original array is not allowed and also try to solve this problem without sorting given array so that it may help you during interviews when modification of original array is disallowed. So write code according to requirement but try both approaches also i.e., by using O(n) extra space without modifying original array and also by sorting given array but don't print anything just keep track of required result using some variable say res or ans etc..

Another solution would be 10 * 15 * 3 * 7 = 3150 (this is not a valid solution as we require that each integer must be used only once). The output should be printed in ascending order with each combination on its own line. The order of numbers within each combination does not matter i.e., both 10+15+3+7 and 7+3+15+10 are considered valid solutions and should only appear once in your output (regardless of which one appears first). Note that you may assume that there will always be at least one solution i.e., it is not necessary to check for cases where no solutions exist for a given input list. If there are multiple solutions with the same set of integers then any one such solution will suffice e.g., both 10*7*3*15 and 10*15*3*7 are correct outputs for this particular case (and only one need appear in your output). You may also assume that no integer will appear more than once within any given combination e.g., you do not need to handle cases such as 2+2+5 or 2*5*5 as these will never occur given our constraints on valid inputs (that each integer can only appear once within any given combination).
