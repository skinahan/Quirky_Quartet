The path can only be constructed out of cells having value 1 and at any point, we can only traverse one step in one of three directions i.e. right or down or diagonally down. The value k will always be greater than or equal to n + m - 2 (maximum possible path length). And you are allowed move only downward, rightward and diagonally downward without repeating any cell more than once in your path. You may start from any cell in first column but you must end at any cell in last column and all intermediate cells must have value 1. Your program should print number of paths satisfying given constraints if there exists such path else print 0 if no such path exists for given input parameters n, m and k where 0 < n < 10^3 , 0 < m < 10^3 , 0 < k < 10^4 . For example consider below matrix for reference : For example consider below matrix for reference : [[1 1 1] [1 1 1] [1 1 1]] There is total 2 paths satisfying above conditions starting from first column ending at last column with 4 steps allowed as shown below : [[1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7] [1 -> 3 -> 6 -> 8]] Note that there is no other path satisfying above conditions with 4 steps allowed starting from first column ending at last column as there is no other valid combination of moves possible starting with (0,0) ending with (2,2) using 4 moves i.e., up/left/diagonal up/diagonal left are not allowed here so our program should print 2 as output as shown below",
