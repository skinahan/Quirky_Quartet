If the length of input string is less than k, then return 0. Consider all possible subsets of input string and find the longest one. For example, if input string is \"abcba\" and k=3 then output will be 3 as \"abc\" is the longest substring having 3 unique characters. If there are more than one such substrings of same length, then print any one of them. The value of k will be less than or equal to 26 (number of lowercase alphabets). The value of k can be anything from 1 to 26 (both inclusive). For example, if input string is \"aabacbebebe\" and k=3 then output will be 5 as \"cbebe\" is the longest substring having 3 unique characters. If there are more than one such substrings of same length, then print any one of them. If there are no such substrings with exactly three unique characters, then simply print \"0\". The value of k can be anything from 1 to 26 (both inclusive). For example, if input string is \"aabacbebebdeee\" and k=3 then output will be 7 as \"acb\", \"cbe\", etc., are some substrings which have exactly three unique characters but out these substrings only \"cbebde\" has maximum length so it should be printed as output. You need to write complete code for this function which takes two arguments - first argument denotes input string and second argument denotes integer value denoting number 'k' as described above. There should not be any leading or trailing spaces in your output strings which means that you need to remove all leading or trailing spaces before printing any output strings on console/screen/file etc., You may assume that there won't be any space character present inside actual input strings itself (i.e., you may assume that each character in actual input strings lies between '!'(33) and '~'(126) both inclusive).\nTask: Write a python function to solve the above question with no additional comments and docstring needed .

If there are no numbers in the string, print \u201cNo numbers\u201d. Return the extracted number as an integer. If there are multiple numbers in the string, print \u201cMany numbers\u201d and return any one of them as an integer. If there is only one number in the string, return that number as an integer. You can ignore floating point numbers and decimal points while extracting integers from a given string. The extracted number cannot be 0 (zero). Assume that there will not be any letters in the string other than alphabets and digits. Ignore whitespaces while extracting a number from a given string. For example, if you are given a text \u201cI have 2 dogs and 6 ponies\u201d then your program should return 2 or 6 depending on how your program handles it but not 26 (the concatenated value of 2 and 6). Also, if you are given \u201cI have 3 dogs\u201d then your program should return 3 but not 33 (the concatenated value of 3 and 3). The output of your function should be an integer data type for all test cases without any exception handling required at this point of time. Your code must not handle exceptions at this point of time; rather it must raise exceptions wherever required according to Python semantics.(exceptions: ValueError , TypeError)\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question.
