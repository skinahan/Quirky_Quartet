Also, find the number of words and characters in the file. The name of the file is stored in the variable filename. Use with open() method to open the file. Note: Do not use any other methods or libraries to solve this problem. Only use with open() method and len() function to find length of data read from a file object using readlines() method. Also, note that you need to close the opened file after reading data from it using close() method on a file object returned by open(). You may also need to strip newline character from each line read from a given file as shown below, line = line[:-1] . The name of the variable containing each line read from a given input text will be line . The variable filename contains name of an existing text file which has some lines of text stored in it and you need to count number of lines, words and characters present in that textfile using above mentioned methods only. Do not use any other methods or libraries for counting purpose like count(), split(), etc...The value returned by your function must be tuple containing three values (number_of_lines, number_of_words, number_of_characters). For example if we have two lines \"Hello World\" and \"Welcome Python\", then output should be (2, 4, 13). If there are no lines/words/characters then respective values should be 0 e-g (0,0,0). Note that we are not interested in counting empty spaces between words or at start/end position for this question so do not include them while counting words and characters for this question but you may still need them while splitting each line into words using split(). This is because empty spaces at start/end position are considered as part of word when splitting a given string into list of words using split(). For example if we have two lines \" Hello World\" and \"Welcome Python \", then output should be (2, 4, 13) instead of (2 ,5 ,14). You can assume that there will always be one space between two consecutive words so you don't have consider case where there are more",

Task: Write a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. Additional info : In mathematics, an Adam number is a number that can be written as sum of its square digit's reverse plus reverse of square digits' sum . For example : 12 is an Adam Number . Square of 12 = 144 Reverse of 12 = 21 Reverse of 144 = 441 Sum of square digits' reverse and reverse of square digits' sum : 441 + 21 = 462 Square root of 462 : 2112 Reverse of 2112 : 2121 So , final result is same as initial value ie., 12 . Task1 : Find out whether given number is palindrome or not ? Task2 : Find out whether given number's square root's reverse plus its reversed value equals original value ? Task3 : If both conditions satisfied , then display \"Adam Number\" otherwise display \"Not an Adam Number\" Answer:: def adamnumber(): num=int(input(\"Enter any integer\")) num1=num*num rev=0 while num>0 : dig=num%10 rev=rev*10+dig num=num//10 sqrroot=rev sq",
