If no such item exists then returns empty dictionary. The function should work with any number of given items and should consider all possible combinations of the given items to match with any sub-set of keys in the dictionary. If there are multiple matches for an item then consider only one match for that item and ignore all other matches for that item. Ignore any duplicates in the list of given items. The same number of elements should be present in both keys and values as well as order should be maintained as per the original dictionary while returning the results (if result is not empty). For example, if input is ({'a': 1, 'b': 2}, ['a']), then output will be {'a': 1}. Similarly if input is ({'a': 4, 'b': 3}, ['b', 'c']), then output will be {'b': 3}. If input is ({'a': 4, 'b': 3}, ['c', 'd']), then output will be {} (empty dictionary). If input is ({'a': 4, 'b': 3}, ['c', 'd', 'e']), then output will be {} (empty dictionary). Note that either order or count or both can differ between two dictionaries but they are considered equal if both contain same set of key value pairs irrespective of their order or count (i.e., {4: 5} == {5: 4} returns True). Also note that you need to write your own code to solve this task; do not use any built-in functions provided by Python's standard library or other libraries like NumPy etc., but you can use built-in functions provided by Python's standard collections module like namedtuple() etc., if needed/desired.) For example, if input is ({('p', 2): 10}, [('p', 2)]), then output will be {('p', 2): 10",
