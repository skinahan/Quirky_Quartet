The function should return the top n words with their frequencies. Ignore punctuations and stopwords, if any. Handle file not found exception.  Assume that the text contains only alphabets and spaces and all words are in lowercase.   Also, sort the output by frequency before returning it.  Return top n words with their frequencies as a list of tuples where each tuple is of format (word, frequency). If two words have same frequency then consider word which occurs first while doing sorting.   Ignore punctuation marks while doing counting operation i.e., don't consider punctuation marks while deciding what constitutes a word or how to break text into words or how to count frequency of each word etc.. However, do not modify the contents of input text file i.e., do not remove punctuation marks from input text file content but treat it as if it does not exist when doing your processing for counting words etc.. Also, use str methods for string operations wherever applicable instead of writing your own utility functions for string operations like you did in assignment 1 (string1-assign).   For example: if input file contains \"Practice makes one perfect.\" then valid outputs are [(perfect, 1), (practice, 1), (makes, 1), (one, 1)] or [(perfect, 1), (practice ,1), (makes ,1), (one ,1)] or [(practice ,1), (perfect ,1), (makes ,1), (one ,1)] etc... You may also write helper utility functions which takes care of some common functionality like removing stopwords/punctuations/converting to lowercase etc... but make sure that you do not repeat code unnecessarily and keep things DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself principle applies here too! This is an open ended question so answer which you provide may be different than what is expected but as long as it satisfies all test cases mentioned in problem statement then it will be considered correct answer! You can assume that there will be no empty lines in input file content and also no extra spaces at beginning/end of line or multiple consecutive spaces",

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string \"\". The trie data structure is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree shows what key it is associated with. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with an empty string.
