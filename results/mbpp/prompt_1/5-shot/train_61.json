The digit 0 maps to 0 itself and 1 maps to 1 itself. For example, if input word is \u201camazon\u201d then output list should contain words like \u201ca6270\u201d and \u201ca6261\u201d among others because these numbers are valid numbers according to phone digit letter mapping mentioned above. If no such words can be formed then output should contain empty list []. Words cannot start with 0 or 1 as per phone digit letter mapping mentioned above. Also, if there is no way possible of replacing letters with digits then output should contain empty list []. Note that each letter always maps to same digit throughout problem statement but one letter can map different digits between problems statements i.e., even though 3rd problem statement says that word \u201camazon\u201d can map into numbers like \u201ca6270\u201d and \u201ca6261\u201d but it does not mean that you can also use those mappings for 2nd problem statement or vice versa because 2nd problem statement says that 3rd index character of input word i.e., m always maps into 6 while 3rd problem statement says that it may map into either 6 or 9 depending on situation so you cannot use mappings from one problem statement in another one unless",
