For example, if we take an array with values [1, -3, 2, 1, -1] and take a number 3 then the result will be 3 (because the sub-array [2, 1] has the maximum sum with length 3). If there are multiple result possible then return all of them. For example if we have an array [1,-3,-5,-6,-10] and take number 5 then result will be [-3,-5,-6]. Note that you can not change the order of elements in any sub-array. Hint: You can use sliding window algorithm to solve this problem. Solve this question without using sorting algorithm and try to solve it in O(n) time complexity. You can assume that all numbers are non-negative integers. The length of input array will not exceed 100000 and you can assume that all numbers are non-negative integers. The length of input array will not exceed 100000 and the value of each integer is at most 10000 . The total number of test cases is 20 . You should pass all test cases to complete this question successfully. Please read the additional info section carefully before writing your solution for this question as it contains important information about how your code should work for different inputs and what output it should return for different test cases.
