Use list comprehension. Do not use any built-in functions.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.  Additional info: Which data structure is being used? Can the task be split into smaller sub-tasks? How many loops are needed to solve the tasks? Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer. Hint: Use set() or dictionary comprehension can be used as an alternative solution for this question, but it is not preferred here in this question as we need to use only list comprehension here in this question and no other builtin functions should be used in this problem statement. The given input list will always contain only string elements and no other elements like integer or float etc., so that there will not be any type errors while removing duplicates from given input list using list comprehension with if condition statement inside it, so that it should return an output of unique element items of given input list without any type errors and also with proper order of unique element items of given input list as shown in expected output section below for various test cases (as shown below). Also note that there will not be any duplicate elements present inside one single element item inside given input list, so that there will not be any errors while removing duplicates from given input list using only if condition statement without using else condition statement inside it, so that it should return an output of unique element items of given input list without any type errors and also with proper order of unique element items of given input list as shown in expected output section below for various test cases (as shown below). For example, if an element item contains two or more duplicate strings within itself like ['a', 'a', 'b'], then we need to avoid such kind of duplicate strings within itself by avoiding such kind of multiple occurrences or repetitions within itself like ['a', 'b'] instead of ['a', 'a', 'b']. So you can modify your code accordingly for such kind special cases where there might occur some special cases where one single string may contain two or more duplicate strings within itself",
