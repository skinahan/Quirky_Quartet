(Assume that all inputs are valid)\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nWhich data structure is being used? Can the task be split into smaller sub-tasks? How many loops are needed to solve the tasks? Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer\n\n Answer:\r\n\n def sum_of_digits(num):\r\n\n    sum = 0;   # Initialize digit sum  \r\n\n    # If number is negative, make it positive  \r\n    if num < 0 :  \r\n        num *= -1;  \r\n\n    while (num > 0 or sum > 9) :   # Loop until no digits left  \r\n\n        if (num == 0) :            # Add last carry, if exists    \r           num = sum;              # Set digitSum as new number for next iteration  \\n\",     \"      sum = 0;          # Reset digitSum for next iteration       \\n\",     \"         \\n\",     \"      while (num > 0) :          \\n\",     \"         sum += num % 10;      \\n\",     \"         num /= 10;       \\n\",     \"      return int(sum);\" ] }, { \"cell_type\": \"code\", \"execution_count\": null, \"metadata\": {}, \"outputs\": [], \"source\": [ \"# Function call\\nsum_of_digits(-123)\" ] } ], \"metadata\": {}, \"nbformat\": 4, \"nbformat_minor\": 2 }"
