You can use standard American denominations, that is, 1\u00a2, 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, and 25\u00a2. For example, given n = 16 you would return 3 since you can make it with a 10\u00a2 coin and two 5\u00a2 coins. For another example given n = 25 you would return 2 since you can make it with two 25 cent coins.\n\n     Task:\n\n     Write a python function to solve the above question.

So Dynamic Programming approach is needed here . We have to build a table from bottom up manner starting from 0 till we reach our target value . Initially we have values at 0th index and then we start building our table by adding each coin value one by one for each index till we reach our target value . We need to take minimum among these values at each index so that we get minimum number of coins used at that index as answer . Finally when we reach target value ,we get our final answeer which is minimum number of coins required to get change using this set of denominations . The code below demonstrates how this logic works :-   # Given an array arr[] of size N containing positive integers representing denominations of N different currencies/coins , find total number of ways to get change for amount V using these denominations ?
