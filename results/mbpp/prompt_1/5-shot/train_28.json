Use the following link to read about the python set() method and how to use it. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-set-method/ https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/set/intersection https://pynative.com/python-set-intersection-example/. You can also use other methods of set() if you wish to do so, but make sure that your solution is correct and efficient enough for this task! Hint: The intersection() method returns a new set with elements that are common to all sets! If you want to learn more about sets, here's another great resource for you! https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp . Also, here's an additional resource on how sets work in Python! https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3462143/get-difference-between-two-lists . Here's one more resource on how sets work in Python! http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/python/. Try solving this task without using any loops or recursions (if possible). If it is not possible, try solving it by using only one loop or recursion (if possible). If it is not possible, try solving it by using two loops or recursions (if possible). And so on...

Return the length of the longest sequence. Ignore duplicates. For example, for [1, 2, 3, 4], the answer is 4 because it has one sequence 1, 2, 3, 4 of consecutive numbers and no other sequences have that many elements. For [1, 2, 3] and [2, 3], the answer is 2 because both have two sequences 1-2 and 2-3 with two elements each.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. For example if input list is [1,-1,-3,-4,-5], then output should be 5 as -3,-4,-5 are consecutive numbers having maximum length 5 as compared to other sequence like -1,-2 which has length only 2. If input list is [-7,-6,-5] then output should be 3 as it has three consecutive numbers having maximum length 3 as compared to other sequence like -8 ,-9 which has length only 1 or -10 which has no element in it at all so its length will be zero in that case so maximum will be taken out of these three lengths i.e., 0 or 1 or 3 . In case of multiple answers return minimum of them .For example if input list is [-7 , 7 , 8 , 9] then output should be minimum out of lengths of these sequences ie., 6 or 7 so output will be 6 . If input list is [] ie., empty list then return value should also be zero . If there are no negative integers present in given array then return value should also be zero .If all integers present in given array are negative then also return value should be zero .If there are no positive integers present in given array but there are negative integers present in given array then return value will always remain zero irrespective of number of negative integers present in that array .If there are positive integers but they don't form any consecutive sequences either by increasing order or decreasing order but they form some random pattern like this :[5 , 9 , 11] where 5 & 11 don't form any consecutive sequence with each other neither do 9 & 11",
