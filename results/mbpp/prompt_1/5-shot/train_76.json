Consider that all characters in the input string are lowercase English alphabets (a-z). Also consider that input string has at least one character. For example, if the input string is \u201cabcba\u201d and k = 2, then the output should be \u201cbcb\u201d. Note that \u201cabcb\u201d would also be accepted as output because it is also a substring with 2 unique characters (however it would not be printed as we have to print only one longest substring).
