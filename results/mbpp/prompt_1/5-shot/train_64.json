Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer\nAnswer: \r\n\n  def sum(numbers):\r\n      total = 0\r\n      for x in numbers:\r\n          total += x\r\n      return total\n\n  print(sum((8, 2, 3, 0, 7)))\n\n  Question:\r\n\n  Write a python function to check whether two lists are equal or not. Two lists are considered equal if both of them contain same set of elements, arrangements (or permutation) of elements may be different though. For example - [1,2] and [2,1] are equal but not [3] and [3]. Note that you can assume that both input lists will have unique elements only. For example - if A= [1,2], B= [2,1], then f([A],[B]) should return True but f([A],[C]) where C=[3], should return False as C is not exactly same as A or B even though it contains same element i.e., 1. Also if A=[] then f([A],[]) should return True since they contain same set of elements i.e., none! Task : Write a python function to solve the above question . No additional comments and docstrings are needed . Additional info : Which data structure is being used ? Can the task be split into smaller sub - tasks ? How many loops are needed to solve the tasks ? Solve sub - tasks iteratively to find the answer Answer : def compare(a , b): if len(a) == 0 and len(b) == 0: # Base case 1 return True elif len(a) != len(b): # Base case 2 return False else : for item in b : if item in a : index = b . index ( item ) del b [ index ] del a [ index ] else : # Base case 3 return False # Rec",
