The first two Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1. The next number is calculated by adding the previous two numbers. The first few elements of fibonacci series are as follows \u2212 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,... . The input of the function is an integer n which specifies the number of elements to be printed in the series. Also write the pytest test cases to test the program. The code file name should be assignment3.py .  Note that there should not any additional commented lines or docstrings other than def block comments and pytest test cases anywhere in your code file. Your program should work for any range of valid inputs which satisfies all constraints mentioned above (for example n=0 or n=2). If it does not work for any particular input value then you will get zero marks for that test case even if your program works fine for other inputs values. Also note that you will get zero marks if you do not write pytest test cases properly and if they don\u2019t cover all possible paths in your program (see lecture 7). You will also get zero marks if there are any additional commented lines or docstrings other than def block comments and pytest test cases anywhere in your code file and also if you do not follow proper naming conventions (see lecture 6).  For example following is a sample run of above program \u2212   >>> fib(5)   [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]   >>> fib(10)   [0, 1, 1, 2, 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34]  Note that here we have used list data structure to store Fibonacci numbers but this is only one way to solve this problem using list data structure but there may be many other ways as well using different data structures like tuple etc so try to think about different ways before writing your final solution otherwise you may end up with wrong solution which gives correct output but doesn\u2019t use correct data structure like tuple etc as required by this question due to lack of understanding about different ways to solve this problem using different data structures like tuple etc",
