The matrix is given as a tuple of tuples with each row as a tuple and each element as an integer. For example, the matrix shown below will be given as (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9). The expected output is 1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5. Note that the output should be printed as a list of integers. For example [1 2 3 6 9 8 7 4 5] is the expected output for the above input. If you are using python2 then use xrange instead of range to make it work in python2 also. Also note that you are only allowed to use one loop while solving this question which means you cannot solve this question by solving sub-problems iteratively and combining them later on to get final answer because that would require more than one loop. You can use other data structures like lists or dictionaries or sets but there should be only one loop used while solving this question and no other loops are allowed to solve this problem. You can also solve it recursively but again there should be only one recursive call and no other recursive calls are allowed to solve this problem which means you cannot divide the problem into smaller sub-problems recursively and combine them later on to get final answer because that would require more than one recursive call. So basically your solution should have only one loop or only one recursive call otherwise your solution will not pass all test cases so please keep that in mind while solving this question because if you don't follow these instructions then your code will fail some test cases even though it may pass all sample test cases provided by us at first glance without any error so please keep these instructions carefully before starting to work on the main task otherwise your code may show runtime error due to exceeding time limit so please keep these instructions carefully before starting to work on the main task otherwise your code may show runtime error due to exceeding time limit during evaluation even though it may pass all sample test cases provided by us at first glance without any error so please keep these instructions carefully before starting to work on the main task otherwise your code may show runtime error due to exceeding time limit during evaluation",

If two or more words are of same length, then return the first word from the list. If no words are found then return None. Consider only alphabets for forming a word and ignore whitespaces and other special characters. Assume that there won't be any empty string in the list of words. Also make sure that all words are converted to lower case before finding the longest word. For example, if input is [\"Hello\", \"World\", \"I\", \"Love\", \"Programming\"], then output should be \"programming\". Please note that output should be a string type value and not a list containing only one element. Similarly, if input is [\"One\",\"Two\",\"Three\"], then output should be \"one\" and not [\"One\"]. Also consider only alphabets while determining the longest word and ignore whitespaces, numbers or any other special characters present in an input string. For example, if input is [\"Hello123\", \"World\"] then answer should still be world because it has more number of alphabetic characters as compared to hello123 (which has 6 alphabetic characters). If all inputs contain only special characters or numbers then return None as shown below: Input : [\u201c1@#$%^&*()\u201d, \u201c2#@!$%&*()\u201d] Output : None Input : [\u201c1234567890987654321012345678909876\u201d] Output : None Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.
