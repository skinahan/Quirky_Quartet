The function should return -1 if there is no second largest number. Do not use built-in functions to solve this question. Write your own logic to solve it. The function should receive an input list as parameter and return the second largest number from that list. Assume that there will be only one such number in the input list. Also assume that all elements in the input list are unique numbers, so duplicates do not exist in it. For example, for an input list [9, 3, 6, 2], your function should return 3 as output since 3 is the second largest element in this list. Similarly for an input list [9, 9] or [9], your function should return -1 since there is no second largest element present in these lists (only one element exists). Use pytest framework to test your solution before submission by using command \"pytest testcases/secondlargestnumberinlisttestcase\".
