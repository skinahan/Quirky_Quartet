Sub-array should contain at least one element. For example, if the array is [\u22122, 1, \u22123, 4, \u22121, 2, 1, \u22125, 4], then contiguous subarray [4,-1] has the largest sum 6. If there are multiple such sub-arrays possible with equal sum then return any one of them. For example if the array is [10,-5,-3,-4,-5], then output will be 10 as all possible contiguous sub-arrays are [-5], [-3], [-4], [-5] and they all have equal sum -13 but since we have to return any one so we will return 10 as it is first among them. Note: You can assume that there is always a non-empty subarray with sum greater than or equal to zero. Also this question has been asked in many forms like finding maximum product instead of maximum sum etc but here we will solve it for maximum sum only and not for anything else.

The number of operations should be minimum. For example, the minimum number of operations required to convert 'kitten' into 'sitting' is 3 (replace k with s, insert i and insert g). Please note that the order of characters does not matter here i.e., we can also start with converting sitting into kitten and then converting kitten into sitting with same intermediate steps and final result but it is not considered as an optimal solution here because we need to find the shortest path from source word (kitten) to destination word (sitting). So, you need to consider all possible ways starting from source word and finally choose the one which has less than or equal operations than all other paths from source word to destination word. Also you are allowed to use only those functions which are mentioned in \u201callowed functions\u201d section below. Use your own custom functions/algorithms wherever needed while implementing this function but do not use any built-in edit distance related functions available in python library such as editdistance etc.. You may import your own custom modules/libraries if needed but do not import any built-in edit distance related modules/functions available in python library such as editdistance etc... You may assume that both words contain only lowercase alphabets \u2018a\u2019 through \u2018z\u2019 without spaces or special characters and both words will have equal length after removing extra spaces if any present at beginning or end of either word or both words before comparing them. Also you are allowed to take two additional arguments for this function apart from two strings (source word and destination word) for which you need to find minimum number of operations required for conversion from source word into destination word by removing, adding or replacing characters using following signature: def min_operations_to_convert(source_word, dest_word, arg1=None, arg2=None).
