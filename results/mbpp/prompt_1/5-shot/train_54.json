Assume that the position of the first queen is known and the positions of all other queens are unknown. The solution should be represented as a list of coordinates for each queen's position. A coordinate (x, y) represents the row number and column number respectively. For example, [(0, 1), (2, 3), (4, 5)] means that there is a queen at position (0, 1), (2, 3) and (4, 5). The output should be a list containing all possible arrangements. All arrangements should be arranged in ascending order based on their first element. For example [(0, 1), (2, 3), ...] comes before [(0, 2), (1 ,3)...] which comes before [(1 ,1), ...]. If there is no arrangement possible then return an empty list otherwise return all possible arrangements in ascending order. Note: There could be multiple solutions for this problem but we are looking for one solution here. Please note that you don't have to print anything it has already been taken care by our grader script. You just need to write your logic here and return the required output from this function only as mentioned above. Hint: You can use backtracking algorithm for solving this question. This question will help you understand backtracking better which will help you solve many problems including some advanced ones like knight's tour problem etc., later on in your career as well :) . Here is how backtracking works: https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/tutorial/. If you don't want to read it then watch this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzONv5kaPJM&list=PLqM7alHXFySEQDk2MDfbwEdjd2svVJH9p&index=11 where they have explained it very nicely with an example puzzle game called 'Missionaries and Cannibals'.

In addition, please provide your understanding of time complexity of your solution by providing a brief comment at end of your code block after return statement like O(n), where n is size of input list etc., so that evaluator can understand what you have done and how efficient solution you have provided for this problem statement.
