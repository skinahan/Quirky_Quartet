Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer. Hint : Use Dynamic Programming approach for solving this problem. If you are not sure about how to solve this problem using dynamic programming refer this link https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-increasing-subsequence-dp-3/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. You can also learn about dynamic programming approach from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.. Note : There may be more than one LIS combination so you can return any one of them but your output should be sorted in ascending order for eg - if your output list contains [4 ,7 ,8 ] then it should be converted into [4 ,7 ,8 ] or [4 ,8 ,7 ]. Similarly if output list contains [4 7 8] then it should be converted into [4 7 8] or [7 4 8]. Also if your output list contains duplicate values then they should be removed as well e .g .if input is given as [] and your output list is like[3 3 9 9 9 15] then it should convert into[3 9 15].

The function should return the output as a list. The numbers greater than 2 are even and if it is divided by 2 then it is not prime number. If there is any other number which divides that number then that number is not a prime number. If none of them divides that number then that number is a prime number. For example, 11 is a prime because no other natural numbers except 1 and itself divide 11. 13 is also another example of prime as no other natural numbers except 1 and itself divide 13. But 15 is not a prime as 3 divides 15 (15/3 = 5). 17, 19 are also examples of primes as they are only divisible by themselves and 1 but 18 (18/3 = 6) and 20 (20/2 = 10) are not primes as they are divisible by 2, 3 respectively without remainder. Hence 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,...are all primes less than or equal to 20 but 4, 6,...are not primes less than or equal to 20. You can use an additional data structure for your convenience in your solution if needed but the input list should be returned back with all the required changes made within the same list in-place without using any additional lists or data structures like sets etc., .
