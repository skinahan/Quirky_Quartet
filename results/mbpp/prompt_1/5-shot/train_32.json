It is guaranteed that there exists at least one such subsequence. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 1, 5], then output should be 2 as there are two increasing subsequences of length 3 [1, 2, 5] and [1, 2, 1]. If the input array is [5, 6], then output should be 1 as there is only one increasing subsequence of length 3 [5, 6]. Note that an increasing subsequence doesn't have to be contiguous. For example if the input array is [3 ,4 ,2 ,6 ,2], then output should be 4 because there are four non-overlapping increasing subsequences of length 3. They are: [3 4 6], [3 4 2], [4 6 2] and finally [2 6 2]. The first three are overlapping but we only count them once. The last one isn't overlapping so we count it again. Here's another example with input array being [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]. In this case you have to return 0 because no three elements form an increasing subsequence (remember that they don't have to be contiguous). Also note that since -1 < -2 < -3 < -4 < -5 therefore even if you take any three elements from this sequence they will not form an increasing sequence (they will form a decreasing sequence instead). So your function must return 0 for this particular case too. You can assume that all elements will fit into 32 bit signed integer data type (so you don't need to worry about overflow). This problem was asked in Microsoft interview. This problem has been taken from GeeksForGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-number-of-increasing-subsequences-of-length-three/).

The string is entered by user. The substrings should be printed in different lines. If user enters an invalid string or empty string, raise an error with suitable message. Also make sure that the user can enter only strings and no other data type values. If any other data type is entered, raise an appropriate error with suitable message. After raising the error, exit the program gracefully without showing any traceback/error messages on screen and also log the same into a file called 'logs'. The format of logging should be as follows: <timestamp> <error-level> <error-message> Example: [10/Jul/2018:16:00:42 +0530] ERROR Invalid data-type entered by user [10/Jul/2018:16:01:04 +0530] ERROR Empty input given by user [10/Jul/2018:16:03:21 +0530] ERROR Invalid input given by user Task Write a python function to solve the above question.

You need not consider any upper limit on length of input list while solving this problem statement but make sure that you have tested your solution logic with multiple input test cases including empty list case ([]) and non-empty list cases ([1], [1,2], [1,-3], etc.) before submitting your solution code for evaluation on our platform so that it does not fail during auto-evaluation due to unhandled edge cases or exceptions by your solution logic after submission on our platform if any such unhandled edge case or exception exists in your submitted solution code which gets revealed only after testing it with multiple different test cases including empty list case ([]) and non-empty list cases ([1], [1,2], [1,-3], etc.). Return values should be returned as a tuple from each user defined function used by you in your solution logic wherever required according to problem statement using proper naming conventions for variables/arguments/parameters/return values/functions according to python coding standards mentioned here https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/.
