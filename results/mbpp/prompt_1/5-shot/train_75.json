A palindrome is a word, phrase, verse, or sentence that reads the same backward or forward. Only the order of English alphabet letters (A-Z and a-z) should be considered while checking for palindromes. For example, \"Madam\" and \"madam\" are both palindromes while \"MadAm\" and \"madamm\" are not palindromes. Also note that single character words are not considered as palindromes by this question. So you do NOT need to worry about strings with just one character like 'a' or 'Z'.\nTask:\nWrite a python function to solve the above question. No additional comments and docstrings are needed. You can use built in functions such as reversed() to solve this problem but you cannot use any other built in functions such as lower() or upper(). Please note that you may use your own helper functions if necessary but they must be written inside this python file only without any import statements in them! You can write your helper functions below this function definition for readability purposes only but please submit all your code in one single .py file only! Don't forget to mention these helper function names in the comment section at the top of this file! Also make sure that all your code is indented properly with 4 spaces per indentation level! Don't forget to test all edge cases thoroughly before submitting your solution!!! Good luck! :) Happy Coding! :D\r\n\n                                                            ############   IMPORTANT   ##############\r\n                                                    #######################################################\n\n    Although we have already covered how to take input from standard input stream (stdin) during our lectures/sessions, we recommend that you don't use stdin here since it will result in TLE (Time Limit Exceeded).
