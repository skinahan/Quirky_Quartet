Note that you can rotate the squares. For example, if n = 4 and m = 5, then there are 8 ways to fill the board using 1 x 1 squares: You can see that it is not possible to place a 2 x 1 domino horizontally on this board, as it will leave a square hole in the middle. However, we can place two 1 x 1 squares in the same position vertically. Thus rotation is allowed. Here are some other examples: Input : n = 3, m = 3 Output : 6 The possible ways are shown below: Input : n = 4, m = 4 Output : 9 The possible ways are shown below: Task: Write a python function to solve the above question.
