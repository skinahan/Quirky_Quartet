You can take 1 or 2 steps at a time. For example, if n is 4, then there are 5 unique ways: 1, 1, 1, 1 2, 1, 1 3, 1 4 ,2 2. Please note that order matters in this case i.e., the order of steps taken matters. So climbing 1 step first and then 2 steps is different from climbing 2 steps first and then 1 step for the above example. Also you cannot jump more than two steps at a time i.e., you cannot take 3 or more steps at once for this problem (as it changes the problem statement). You need to find all possible combinations of taking either one or two steps at a time to reach nth step from 0th step (assuming 0th step is already reached). For example if n=4 and you are currently on 0th step then you can either take one step to reach first step or jump directly by taking two steps to reach second step but you cannot jump directly by taking three or more than three steps as it violates our problem statement that we can only take either one or two steps at a time. The order in which we are taking these single/double jumps matter as explained above for our solution set so [2,1] and [1,2] are considered different solutions for this problem even though they cover same number of total jumps (i.e., 3 jumps) from 0th position to 4th position in same amount of time but their order matters as explained earlier so they are considered different solutions for our problem statement here.. Hint: Dynamic Programming approach will be useful here! Note: There may be other approaches too but dynamic programming approach will be most optimal solution here!
