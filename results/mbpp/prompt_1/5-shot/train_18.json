No additional comments and docstrings are needed.\nAdditional info:\nWhich data structure is being used? Can the task be split into smaller sub-tasks? How many loops are needed to solve the tasks? Solve sub-tasks iteratively to find the answer. You can use only one loop and one recursion call in this task. Try to figure out how many times recursion will be called before you write your code. You can use any data structure for this task, but you cannot use any builtin function to solve this problem (like sum(), reduce() etc) except len(). Also note that you cannot use any other variable than given ones, like temp variables or variables with different names etc. You have only two variables and one loop at your disposal so try not to waste them!  (Hint: For e.g., if you have a list lst = [1,2,3], then len(lst) will give 3 as output). This is an interesting problem which has been asked by several big companies like Microsoft and Amazon, so try solving it!

You should not use the built-in sum function. You can assume that the list is non-empty and all elements are integers. The average of an empty list is undefined, so you do not need to consider this case. Your solution must run in linear time, i.e., O(n). That is, you cannot just go through the list once, compute something and go through it again to compute something else (this would be O(2n) which simplifies to O(n)). Instead, your algorithm should require only one iteration over the elements of the input list. Hint: What do you need to keep track of as you iterate over the input? How can you use that information to compute both sum and count at once? What other values might be useful? What are their types? Try drawing out some examples by hand on paper before writing any code! As always for these problems, we encourage you to think about how your solution would scale for very large inputs before writing any code! For example: If I give your program a million numbers as input will it still run quickly or will it take forever? Make sure your answer has a clear explanation justifying why! This question requires some thought but there is no coding involved so we won't test your final answer with our grader - just submit anything here and we'll take a look at it manually!
